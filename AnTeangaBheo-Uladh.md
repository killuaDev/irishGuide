## 1. Pronunciation
### 1.1 Stress
In Ulster, stress is usually on the first syllable. There's a strong tendency because of that to shorten the vowels in the unstressed syllables. Even though there's a fada symbol on the vowels in the second/third syllable in the words below, they're said as short vowels usually. The same with the *eo(i)* in the second syllable of the words, it's said as a short *o*. In the samples bellow, *eô* shows that there's a short *o*. The *e* sound, like in the english word *let* is used for *éi/ae* in unstressed syllables. When the dialectal form of the word is different from the standard form, I give the standard version in parentheses.

 |                 |  Word            |  Pronunciation |
 | --------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
 | **á > a**       | *amadán*            | *amadan*    |
 |                 | *urlár*             | *urlar*     |
 |                 | *sábháil*           | *sábhail*   |
 |                 | *coimeád*           | *coimead*   |
 |                 | *oileán*            | *oilean*    |
 | **ó > o**       | *bábóg*             | *bábog*     |
 |                 | *siopadóir*         | *siopadoir* |
 |                 | *trioblóid*         | *triobloid* |
 |                 | *fuinneog*          | *fuinneôg*  |
 |                 | *ainneoin*          | *ainneôin*  |
 | **ú > u**       | *galún*             | *galun*     |
 |                 | *séasúr*            | *séasur*    |
 |                 | *cosúil*            | *cosuil*    |
 | **é > e**       | *buidéil* (plural)   | *buideil*   |
 |                 | *sciléid (sciléad)* | *scileid*   |
 |                 | *bucaeid (buicéad)* | *buc(a)eid* |
 | **éa > ea = a** | *coirnéal*          | *coirneal*  |
 |                 | *buidéal*           | *buideal*   |
 |                 | *leithscéal*        | *leisceal*  |
 |                 | *suipéar*           | *suipear*   |

When a word ends in *-ín* or when *-ao(i)* is in an unstressed syllable in a word, the long vowel is shortened as well, but often it's often left long or half-length.

| Word        | Pronunciation         |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| cipín       | cipin/cipín           |
| cailín      | cailin/cailín         |
| Nóirín      | Nóirin/Nóirín         |
| cathaoir    | caithir/caithír       |
| Dé Céadaoin | Dé Céadaine/Céadaoine |

#### Shortening of Long Vowels Generally
Regarding the long vowels which are shortened in unstressed syllables, the following should be said about them.

(a) In the southern half of Donegal, the quality of the vowel is kept when it's shortened and it's often half-length.

(b) In the northern half of the county, in the Rosa, Gaoth Dobhair and in Cloch Cheannaola, the quality of the shortened vowel is kept as well. There is a tendency though to have a neutral vowel, as is in the first syllable of the words *anois/arís*, in place of the shortened vowels in those areas. This happens especially when *ú* and *í* are shortened.

(c) This tendency of using a neutral vowel in the second syllable is stronger the further you go towards Ros Goill, An Tearmainn and Fhánada. This tendency was also found in East Ulster when it was still spoken.

### 1.2 Compound Words
When a compound word is made with a long vowel in the second part of it, the vowel in that part is shortened if the first syllable of the compound word has the strongest stress.

| Word       | Pronunciation |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| leathshúil | leathshuil    |
| seanbhróg  | seanbhrog     |
| muiceoil   | muiceôil      |
| coiscéim   | coisceim      |
| aimhréidh  | aimhreidh     |

When the compound word ends on a vowel there is a tendency to keep that vowel half length.
- *bunbhrí* *bunbhri/bunbhrí*
- seanbhó seanbho/seanbhó
- corrlá corrla/corrlá

### 1.3 Stressed Vowels
Stressed long vowels and diphthongs in the first syllable of words are shortened in many contexts. It's not quite the same in any two subdialects. This shortening regularly happens before *th* but it happens in many other contexts which aren't easy to describe. Below are representative samples of words where the change applies. Anywhere the shortening makes the word hard to recognise, the root version is given in parentheses. That form is not always in accordance with the Official Standard.

(a) *'á'* go *a*
- *athas, mathair, faoi lathair, aiteacha* (áit+eacha), *sraiteacha* (sráid+theacha), *sraideog* (sráideog), *bainín* (báinín), *Manas Mór* (Mánas Mór).

(b) *'é'* go *'e'*
+ *ce(a)lacan, cre(a)fóg, e(a)drom, me(a)nar, sce(a)la, an che(a)d duine, b'eigean, e(a)dáil, cl(a)eifeacha* (plural of claíomh < claidhimh+theacha), *b'fheidir, le(a)pacha* (leadhb+thacha), *seideán, seideog,*

(c) *í* go *i*
+ *sil (síl), spi(o)nógaí, tchifidh, fi(o)dóir, diocacha* (díog+thacha), *trihú* (tríú)

(d) *'ó'* go *'o'*
+ (ag baint) *monadh* (móna), *morán*, *cota mór*, *ogánach*

(e) *'ú'* to *'u'*
+ *crubóg, curamach, duirt sé, Dun Fionnachaidh, Dun na nGall, Hiudaí, Na Dunaibh, munadh, sugán, suile buidhe, suiliní*

(f) long *'ao'* to short *'ao'*
+ *caoradóir, faochóg, faoileog, gaothach, maoilín, saothar*

(g) *'ua'* to *'u/o'*
+ *bochaill* (buachaill), *bu(a)iltín, bu(a)taise, fu(a)iscneach, gru(a)imhín), gu(a)lainn, ag cu(a)rtannaigh* (= ag airneán), *slu(a)said, tu(a)rastal, wochtar* (uachtar)

(h) *'ia'* to *'i/yi'*
+ *yi(o)d héin* (iad féin), *yirann* (iarann), *yirraidh* (iarraidh), *yiragúlta* (iargúlta), *yiróg* (iaróg), *yiscaire* (iascaire)
+ *bri(a)thar, sci(a)theán, mial (míol)* but *myiltóg* (míoltóg)

Note that 'ia' + 'bh' has the /ou/ in the english word *sound* in certain areas, within words like these.
+ *cleabhán* (cliabhán), *deabhal* (diabhal), *feabhraigh* (fiafraigh), *feabhras* (fiabhras)

### 1.4 Shortening of Vowels in Monosyllabic Words
(a) *Má/Dá* the vowels in these words are rarely long. If there's some emphasis on them, they're said with a short *a* like in the word *mac*. If there's no emphasis on them at all, they're said as a neutral vowel like in the first syllable of the word *arís*. The symbol \[ə] is used bellow to represent the netural vowel. The *'d'* in *Dá* is often dropped.
+ *Ma/Mə bhíonn sé ann, labhair leis*
+ *Da/Də mbeinn chugam féin, rachainn libh.*
+ *Ba cheart duit a bheith ann (d)a/(d)ə dtiocfadh leat é.*

(b) *Dé* This is said as a short *e* or \[ə].
+ *De/Də Luain/Máirt* etc.

(c) Féile go *'(i)l/Feil'*
+ *Lá(i)l Bríde/Pádraig (Lá Fhéile Bríde/Pádraig)*
+ *Oícheil Eoin (Oíche Fhéile Eoin)*
+ *Lá(i)l Muire Mór san Fhómhar (Lá Fhéile)*

but
+ *Rabharta na Feil Muire*
+ Oíche cheann Féile
+ Mí na Feil Bríde
+ Lá Féile an lá inniu

(d) Ó in surnames. Ó in surnames isn't stressed and as a result of that, it's said as a short *a* or a neutral vowel \[ə].
+ Seán a/ə Gallchóir
+ Jimí a/ə Dubhchon

(e) Mac in surnames. It's not typical to pronounce the *M* in *Mac* except when the name is being called out officially or when the first name omitted. There's a strong tendency to make a *g* out of the last *c* before vowels and before surnames that start with *r/l*. The *a* is often said as \[ə].
+ *Tadhg (M)ac Pháidín/Suibhne*
+ Seán (M)ag Aodha
+ (M)ag Aodha/Fhloinn/Lochlainn/Rabhartaigh (broad 'g')
+ Mánas (M)ag Éidí/Fhionnaile/Íomhair ('g' caol)
+ Eoghan (M)a Giolla Bhríde/Chóill ('c/g' ar lár)

### 1.5 polysyllabic Words Ending with *'-adh/-amh/-odh*
-(e)adh/-odh/-(e)amh in polysyllabic words are said like the *u* at the end of *Zulu*. They're found words like the following. *ú* is used to show the pronunciation:

(a) Nouns: *molú* (moladh), *bualú* (bualadh), *Samhrú* (Samhradh), *Geimhriú* (Geimhreadh), *talú/tolú* (talamh).

(b) Verbal nouns: *ag glanú* (ag glanadh), *ag déanú* (ag déanamh).

(c) Verb endings: *bíú* (bíodh), *crochú é* (crochadh), *brisiú iad* (briseadh), *mholhú Seán thú* (mholfadh).

### 1.6 *Idh/Igh* at the End of Words
The *dh/gh* in single syllable words is said just how it's said at the start of words like *ghearr, dhíol a Dhia!* etc. We're showing the pronunciation of *dh/gh* in these words with the symbol /y/. It's almost the same as the *y* sound in the English word *yes.*

| Word    | Pronunciation |
| ------- | ------------- |
| *chuaigh* | *chuay*         |
| *dóigh*   | dóy           |
| *faigh*\*   | fáy           |
| *léigh*   | *léy*           |
| *nigh*    | *niy*           |
| *luigh*   | *loy/luíy*      | 

\* The spelling *fagh* is often found in writings. It shows that *fa* is said, and that is a common pronunciation before words starting with a consonant, like this: *fa greim air, fa luach deich bpunta* etc. In cases of that kind, the verb receives little stress.

Often the standard form of words leaves out this *-idh/-igh.* In the examples below the old spelling is given along with the standard.

| Standard | Old Spelling | Pronunciation |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| crua     | cruaidh      | cruay         |
| bua      | buaidh       | buay(e)       |
| trua     | truaighe     | truaye        |
| pá       | páigh(e)     | páye          |

### 1.7 Broad *mh/bh*
(i) *w* like in the English word *watch* is the normal sound for *mh/bh* (a) at the start of a word or after prefixes, and (b) after a long vowel or after the diphthongs *ia* and *ua* in the middle/end of a word. There is strong nasalisation on the *w* from *mh* usually.
- (a) *A Mháire, rómhaith, mharaigh; bhuail, bhain, róbhog, an bhó.*
- (b) *ag léamh, ag snámh, An Fómhar, lámh, lámha, Mac Íomhair, (a)riamh, Niamh, sciamhach; ábhar, cliabh, sliabh, riabhóg*

(ii) *(e)amh* in the middle of words and at the end of monosyllabic words has a sound like the *ow* in the English word *cow*. The same diphthong is in some words which have *abh* in the middle, especially words which have a consonant after that *bh*, and in the words *domhan* in some areas, but read (iii) below.
- *amhlaidh, damhsa, gamhain, Samhradh, sleamhain, ramhar; amh, Neamh, snamh; breabhsánta, cabhlach, cabhsa, fabhair, slabhra; domhan.*

(iii) *(e)abh, omh* and *obh* in the middle of words usually have the *ó* sound.
- *abhainn, cabhair, gabhar, labhair, leabhar, meabhair, rabharta, seabhac.*
- *comhairle, comhrá, domhan, Domhnach, tomhas; lobhar dobharchú, Gaoth Dobhair*

### 1.8 Slender *mh/bh*
Slender *mh/bh* are the same every where, at the start, middle, and end of a word. It's similar to the *v* sound in the English words *very, live* except that it's bilabial.
- Start of a word: *an mhín, mhionnaigh, sé mhí; an bhean, bhí, bhris*
- Middle of a word: *ainmhí, cuimhne, roimhe, rómhinic, uimhir; aoibhneas, cuibhreann, róbheag, saibhir, taibhse; uibheacha*
- End of a word: *nimh, scéimh, séimh; ar na mallaibh, bainne an linbh, daoibh, libh, luibh, sibh; arbh fhiú, seilbh, tairbh*

### 1.9 *a(i)dh, a(i)gh, eadh, eidh, eagh, eigh, oidh, o(i)gh in the Middle of a Word*
### (a) a(i)dh/a(i)gh
*adh/agh* is pronounced as a long vowel in the middle of words. It's similar to the vowel sound *ae* in the word *Gael*. *aidh/aigh* and *adh/agh* are the same sound across Ulster, generally except that the dipthong in the English word *height* is used before dental consonants like *d, n, s* and *t,* in Donegal Irish. The Official Standard is in parentheses below when it would distort the pronunciation

(i) Long Vowel
*adharc, cladhaire, radharc, Tadhg; aghaidh, laghad, slaghdán; A Thaidhg, claidheamh* (claíomh), *saidhbhir* (saibhir), *saighead*, staighre

(ii) Diphthong
*maighdean, maighistir* (máistir), *saighdiúir, saighneán*

In East Ulster, they would have had a short vowel in these as well. Note the word *maidhean* in the well known poem "Úr-Chnoc Chéin Mhic Cáinte".
> A phlúr na *maighdean* is úire *gné*
> 
> Thug clú le *scéimh* ón Adhamhchlainn
> 
> A chúl na *bpéarla*, a rún na *héigse*
> 
> A dhúblas *féile* is fáilte

(b) *ogh/oigh/oidh*
These have the same sound as *agh/aigh/aidh.*
+ *rogha, togha, foighid, oidhre*

(c) *eidh/eigh/eadh/eagh*
*eidh/eigh* in the middle of a word is a long vowel like é, likewise with *eadh* before a consonant in a single syllable word:
+ eidhneán, leigheas, leadhb, meadhg

In polysyllabic with *eadh* in the middle, there are two ways to say it (a) as *agh* pronouncin the *gh* as it is at the start of a word, and (b) as a diphthong like in the English word *height*. Usually pronunciation (a) is found among those who have an unrounded *ú* for *ao* and pronunciation (b) among those who say *ao* as *í*.
+ *ar feadh, adhradh, is eadh* (is ea), *meadhar* (meidhir), *meadhrach* (meidhreach), *feadhnóg, sleagh* (sleá), *sniodh, teaghlach* and also in the words *saghart* (sagart), *teaghasc* (teagasc)

In you also get a diphthong in *agam, agat, againn* and *agaibh* in Teileann and Gleann Cholm Cille in North Donegal.

### 1.10 Fuaimniú *ao/aoi*
There are two pronunciations used for the spelling *ao*

(a) unrounded *ú* and (b) *í.*

(i) (a) was the most common pronunciation across Ulster when Irish was strong, and it's still very common in donegal. *í* is a very common pronunciation in the south of the county, in Árainn Mhór, in a good bit of Gaoth Dobhair and in Ros Goill in the north of the county. It's what was in Cavan Irish when it was still spoken.
+ *aon, aos óg, braon, caol, caora, daor, gaol, naomh, ar maos, saol, saor, taobh*

(ii) In the subdialects which have unrounded *ú* as a pronunciation of *ao*, it's normal that it's also in the other forms of those words, for exxample the genitive case or the comparative adjectives.
+ *lá na gaoithe, tús an tsaoil, caoirigh, níos caoile/daoire/saoire*

(iii) The same unrounded *ú* is in words like these.
+ *aois, ar saoire, daoiní* (daoine), *faoileog* (faoileán), *saoirse, scaoil, smaoiteamh* (smaoineamh), snaoisín

(iv) There's a few other words which have the unrounded *ú* even though you wouldn't expect it from their spelling
+ *oíche, choíche, iontach*

(v) The *u* in the following words is pronounced as an unrounded *u* by the people who have an unrounded *ú* for *ao/aoi*. It's usually half length. In the areas of Donegal where *ao* is said as *í*, this *u* is said as a half-length *i*. Note that these words all start with labial consonants *b, bh, f* etc.
+ *buail, buaidhe* (bua), *fuacht, fuar, fuáil, spuaic (bh)uaim, (bh)uait* etc.

(vi) Long *í* for *aoi* is very common across Ulster when it's not followed by a consonant and in a few other words
+ *caoi, draoi, faoi, gnaoi, naoi, saoi, An Aoine, baois, Déardaoin, maoin, faoiside* (faoistin), *Taoiseach.*

### Vowel Contrast Generally

### 1.11 Long Vowels
Note now that the following distinctions are found in the vowel system of Ulster Irish.

(a) In the dialects which have unrounded *u* for *ao*, there's a distinction between *í - ao - ú*.
+ *thíos:aosta, ag guí:gaoth, caol:cúl, aol:úlla*

(b) In the same way there's a distinction between the two types of *é* in many subdialects, in pairs like these:
+ *éan:aon, ré:rogha, a théamh:a thoghadh*

(c) Note as well that two types of *ó* are heard in the dialects of the North. One is called closed *ó* (like the *o* in the English word *more*), the other is called open *ó* (like the *aw* in the English word *paw*). The closed *ó* is usually found beside the consonants *m, mh* or *n.* The closed ó comes first in these examples.
+ *tóg:óg, mór:ór, níos mó:bó, Eoin:a Eoghain, comhartha:cófra*

Especially note that the spellings *-(e)abha-, -obha-, -odha-,* and *-ogha-* use the closed *ó*. This historical change adds contributes a lot of distinctions between closed *ó* and open *ó*.
+ *leabhar:leor, cabhair:cóir, tabhair:tóir, gabhal:ag ól, bodhar:ór, lobhadh:lód, loghadh:dódh*

### 1.12 Short Vowels
Regarding short vowels, there are distinctions in Ulster Irish which aren't in other dialects. Pay particular attention to the distinction between closed *i* and open *i*. The latter is similar to English *i* in words like *hit, sin* etc. The closed *i* is closer to the sound in English words like *meet, seat* etc. The two types of *i* are shown in the following examples, the closed form coming first.
+ *aic**i** : aig**e**, síl : sil, ith : im, filí : file* etc.

Just like with the long vowels, a distinction is made between the two short *o* sounds in Ulster Irish. In the examples below the open *o* is the one in the second spot.
+ *corr* (gob) *: corr* (aisteach), *ucht : ocht, ag cur : cor, ar gor : gorm, mothú : rotha*

### Miscellaneous

### 1.13 *a/o* roimh *ch*.
(a) Note that a clear *a* like in the Irish word *mac* is said before *ch* in words like these below.
+ *cladach, ag ceannach(t), éadach, salach* etc.
+ *ainmneacha, loirgneacha* (lorgaí), *maidineacha* etc.

(b) Even though *o* is written before *ch* in words like the following, it is pronounced a clear *a* in Ulster Irish. The pronunciation of the words is given between parentheses ().
+ *buíoch (buí-ach), buíochas (buí-ach-as), gaiscíoch (gais-cí-ach), cleasaíocht (cleas-aí-acht), filíocht (fil-í-acht) etc.

(c) There is a *h* in the middle of the following words and they have 3 syllables. The *í* in them is shortened but it keeps its original quality.
+ *rihachta* (ríocht), *druiheachta* (draíocht)

but
+ go dtige do rí-acht (in the Prayer)

### 1.14 Change between *o* and *a*
#### 1.14.1 The Change from *o* to *a*
This is a common change in many words. This change has been in the language since the time of old irish where you get both spellings. It most often happens before the consonants *l, r, s* and *t*. Here's some examples.
+ *arm* (orm)
+ *arthu* (orth*u*)
+ *ar char ar bith* (chor)
+ *ar scar ar bith* (scor)
+ *bas* (bos)
+ *brallach* (brollach)
+ *call* (coll)
+ *capógach* (copóg(ach))
+ *casán* (cosán)
+ *cras* (cros)
+ *craisbhealach* (crosbhealach)
+ *dailigh* (doiligh)
+ *daras* (doras)
+ *fasta* (fosta)
+ *fastaigh* (fostaigh)
+ *gaile* (goile)
+ *larg* (lorg)
+ *tarmán* (tormán),
+ *pata* (pota)
+ *pártán* (portán)
+ *spat(a)* (spota)
+ *táirneach* (toirneach)

*a* is also said in the following words.
+ *eanann* (ionann), *seamra* (seomra), *seapa* (siopa)

#### 1.14.2 The Change from *a* to *o*
This is a change which is very widespread in the dialects of the north. It's usually found before a back *l*, but it's often found before a back *ll* too. The rule only rarely affects *ea* before those consonants. The new pronunciation is similar to the vowel in the Irish word *seo* or in the English word *hot* as it's said in Scotland.
+ *Olbain* (Albain), *bolbh* (balbh), *dolba* (dalba), *golánta* (galánta), *golar* (galar), *loch* (lacha), *molairt* (malairt), *solann* (salann) etc.
+ *ollas* (allas), *Ó Gollchóir* (Ó Gallchóir), *moll* (mall), *mollacht* (mallacht).
+ *los* (las), *oiteanach* (aiteannach), *moidin* (maidin)

### 1.15 Raising of *a* and *á*.
#### 1.15.1 The Pronunciation of Short *a*
The short *a* changes a lot depending on the context it's in. Generally, there is a front *a* (like the *a* in English words like *hat, rap* etc.) in the first set of words below and a back *a* (which is more like the vowel in the English words *hot, stop* etc.) in the examples in the second set.
+ ***a* tosaigh** *bean, cead, easóg, fear, nead, teas; cas, garbh, fada, fan, hata, tana; ainm, cailc, cailleach, caint, dainséar, gaineamh, Laidin, saill, taisme*
+ ***a* cúil** *abair, Anna, am, bacach, balla, callán, cam, canna, capall, carraig, sac, paca, taca*

#### 1.15.2 Raising of the Short *a*
In several subdialects, especially in the northwest and north of Donegal, and in other parts of Ulster when Irish was spoken in them, the *a* which was in the words below historically, was raised so that it became more like the *e* in English words like *get, help* etc. The raising most often happens before the consonants *d, n, l, t* and *s* both broad and slender.
+ *cas, cat, garbh, fada, fan, gadaí, hata, marbh, tana (tanaí)*
+ *ainm, cailc, dainséar, gaineamh, gaisce, Laidin, saill, taisme*

The same sound is found in words like *bean, fear* etc. Of course it is a sound like this which was in these words historically, and in all likelihood the vowel in words of that sort haven't changed since the times of old irish. The historical vowel is most often kepped before the broad consonants *d, n, t, th, r* and *s.*
+ *bean, bearach, cead, ceathair, easóg, fear, leat, leathar, meath, nead, peata, (uisce) reatha, sean, teas*

The historical vowel is lowered everywehre else. Short *a* is typical in words like those below and I would say the lowering is caused by the nature of the consonant which follows *ea* in the spelling.
+ *bealach, ceart, cearr, ceap, dream, feamnach* (feamainn), *fearthainn, geal, geall, leabaidh* (leaba), *peacadh* (peacadh), *seacht, seachtain, seang, teacht, teampall*

##### Back *a*
There's a tendency to say back *a* in certain words. This is caused by the nature of the consonants before the *a*. *b, f, m* and *p* tend to be very broad, and often a glide like *w* is heard after them. The broadening and this *w* bring the vowel back.
+ *baile, bainis, faic, faill, maide, maidin, paidir*

##### *ai* = /i/
In some specific cases, the spelling *ai* is pronounced as /i/. The following is a list of the contexts where /i/ is found.

In the base words
+ *aibhleog, aici, aige, aire, bail, bain(t), cnaipe, gairid, maise, saint*

In the genitive singular/nominative plural
+ *ag tógáil airm, cos an chait, bun an chrainn, barr na slaite*
+ *na cait, na crainn, na daill, na hairm, na glais, na mairbh*

##### *ea* = *io*
This pronunciation is mostly found before *g.*
+ *beag, beagán, creag, eag* (eang), *ní heagal dó, eagla, An Eaglais, leag, seagal; ceann, leann, seangán*

#### 1.15.3 The Raising of *á*
The raising that happens to *á* is even more prevelant than the raising of short *a*. The change is gradiated from place to place. Little of the raising happens in the southern half of Donegal, in the Gaeltacht Láir, Gleann Cholmcille, and Teileann. In the northern half of the county, this change is abundant. The quality of the long *á* is the same as that of the short *a* which is raised and which is mentioned above in 1.15.2. The change is most often found before slender consonants and broad *d, r, s* and *t*.
+ *Áine, áit, áithe, báillí, cáil, cáin, cáis, ag fáil, fáilte, Gráinne, láidir, náire, páiste, bád, bás, cás, cár, cnádán, fás, lár, ráta, spás*

In much of the Gaoth Dobhair parish, for example, *á* is raised before every consonant, broad or slender.

Often, even in the areas which don't raise the long *a* before broad consonants, the raising happens when the word is in the genitive, or when the comparative or superlative of an adjective is used, that is, when a slender consonant comes directly after the *á.*

| No raising | Raised                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| *lámh*     | *taobh na láimhe deise* |
| *bán*      | *níos báine*            |
| *bál*      | *ag imirt báil*         |
| *sál*      | *ar mo sháil*           |

### 1.16 The Pronunciation of Consonants
#### 1.16.1 ll/nn/rr and l/n/r
(a) Anyone who wants to learn the Irish of the north has to grasp reasonably well the distinction between the pronunciations of *ll* and *l*, *nn* and *n*, and *rr* and *r*. This contrast is extremely important in the dialect. Often there is no difference between pairs of words except for the pronounciation of the consonants *ll/l*, nn/n or *rr/r* in them. In order to make *ll* and *nn*, *the whole front of the tongue* is put against the top teeth when they're broad, and against the bottom teeth and the ridge of the teeth when they're slender. To say *l* and *n*, *the tip of the tongue* is put against the ridge of the teeth. Of course, along with tip or the front part of the tongue, the back of the tongue is raised towards the soft palate when saying broad consonants the front of the tongue towards the hard palate when saying slender consonants. Note as well that the vowels in the monosyllabic words below aren't lengthened as they are in other dialects.
+ *gann/gan mionna/miona, donna/dona, leann/lean, léann/mo léan*
+ *fáinne/Áine, sa bhinn/sa mhin, tinneas/tinidh* (tine), *crainn/bain*
+ *geall/geal, olla/ola, Gall/gal, balla/geala, eallach/eala*
+ *céille/céile, mill/mil, linn (uisce)/linn, leis (corp)/leis*

(b) Regarding the contrast between *rr* and *r*, it doesn't come up except for in a few words. The contrast doesn't exist except with broad consonants. To pronounce broad *rr*, strong hits are made on the back of the ridge of the teeth, and to make a broad *r* only one hit is done. This distinction may not be preserved in every subdialect.
Here are some examples.
+ *corr* (gob)/*cur, tarraing/tar, carraig/cara, i gcarr/gar farraige/arm*
+ *corr/cur/cuir, farraige/faraor/faire, urraim/orm/coirm, barr/ár/báire*

#### 1.16.2 Long Vowels before *rr, rd, rn* and *rl*
The vowel *a* is long in the following words before *rr* this length is often maintained when another syllable is added to the root. Note that the *a* is short before *rr* in words that don't come from a monosyllabic root.
+ long *á* - *barr, carr, carrannaí* (carrannna), *is fearr, ghearr, gearrann,*
+ short *a* - *carraig, , an tEarrach, an fharraige, searrach, tarraing*

It's also normal to have a long vowel before the groups *rd, rn* and *rl* in the Irish of the North.
+ long *á* - *ard, aird, in airde, bearna(idh), cairde, ceardaí, carn, marla, tairne, Tarlach, tharla(igh),*
+ long *ó* - *bord, dorn, dornán, ord, ordóg, Orla, orlach*
+ long *ú* - *murnán, tuirne*

The words below have a short vowel
+ *airde, mirlín, murlas, turdán, turlach, turn, uirlis, urnaí*

### 1.17 The Pronunciation of *ch*
#### 1.17.1 Broad *ch*
(a) At the start of words a strong *ch* is heard.
+ *chaith, mo charr/chos/chluas* etc.

(b) In the middle/end of words the *ch* is usually weakened to */h/*.
+ *cladach, amach, easnacha, eochair, cloch(a)* etc.

(c) Sometimes, *ch* has an *r* sound before *t* in some of the subdialects (Gaoth Dobhair, Toraigh, Tír Eoghain).
+ *lort* (locht), *ort* (ocht), *bort* (bocht), *ag teart* (ag teacht) etc.

(d) *ch* is pronounced as */h/*  in the preposition *chun/chuig* and sometimes it's completely left out.
+ *(h)ugam* (chugam), *(h)ugad* (chugat), *(h)uige* (chuige), *na bhaile* (chun an bhaile), *na scoile* (chun na scoile), *a naonaigh* (chun aonaigh) srl.

#### 1.17.2 Slender *ch*
It's said as a strong *ch* in every position, at the start, middle, and end of words usually. There's a certain tendency however to make it into a */h/* between two vowels
+ *cheannaigh, mícheart, mo chead, cluiche, droichead, fiche, Micheál, oíche, ar an chloich* (cloch)

### 1.18 The Pronunciation of Slender *th*
Like *h*

(i) At the start of a word
+ *thiar, thíos, thit, róthirim*

(ii) In the middle and at the end of a word, usually
+ *leithead, mithid, reithe, sceith, theith, ar bith*

Like *h* or slender *ch*

(iii) There's a large tendency to turn slender *th* into slender *ch* in words where the letters *ai/ei/oi* or *ái/éi* are in the stressed syllable. *ai/ei/oi* before *th* is pronounced as a diphthong like in the English word *my*
+ *caith, maith, Na Flaithis, ar leith, léithe* (léi), *ráithe, scoith, snáithe* etc.

### 1.19 *n* to *r*
(a) Although *n* is written in words like those below, *r* is said. 
+ *cnámh, cnoc, gnách, gnaíúil, gníomh, gnoithe mná, tnúth* etc.

(b) *tsn* is said as *tr* in forms like the following:
+ *snaidhm/an tsnaidhm, snagaireacht/an tsnagaireacht, snámh/ar an tsnámh, snáithe/leis an tsnáithe, sneachta/sa tseachta*

### 1.20 Missing *n*
The *n* is dropped in the following words.
+ *áró* (anró), *bárín* (banrí(o)n), *ichinn* (inchinn), *muichille* (muinchille), *muitir* (muintir), *scáraigh* (scanraigh), *sórú* (sonrú), *sóraitheach* (sonraitheach) etc.

### 1.21 Slenderisation of Consonants
Slender consonants are typical at the start of the words below.
*dheá* (dhá), *a dheath* (a dhath), *cliú* (clú), *dreabhlás* (drabhlás), *driúchta* (drúchta), *scriúdú* (scrúdú), *seórt* (sórt), *tilleadh* (tuilleadh)

### 1.22 The Ending *-(a)ithe*
#### 1.22.1 Second Conjugation Verbs ending in *-(a)igh.*
There are two ways in Ulster Irish to make verbal adjective endings from verbs which have *-(a)igh* in the second person singular imperative. I show the two ways using the spelling *-(a)í* and *-(a)iste/-(a)íste.* The sound in *-(a)í* in these endings is the same as the *aí* in the word *urnaí.* In the Official Standard you get the ending *-(a)ithe*.
+ *ceannaí/ceannaiste/ceannaíste* (ceannaithe), *ordaí/ordaiste/ordaíste* (ordaithe), *cruinní/cruinniste/cruinníste* (cruinnithe)

#### 1.22.2 Syncopated Verbs
The endings mentioned in 1.22.1 above are added to syncopated verbs ending in *-ir, -in,* for example, *díbir, cogain, imir, rómhair* etc. as well. *-tha* isn't added to them as in the Standard.
+ *díbrí/díbriste/díbríste* (díbeartha)
+ *cognaí/cognaiste/cognaíste* (coganta)
+ *imrí/imriste/imríste* (imeartha)
+ *rómhraí/rómhraiste/rómhraíste* (rómhartha)

The same system applies to syncopated verbs ending in *-il* except that in their case there is a third choice, that is, using one of the endings *-te* or *-ta.* That much agrees with the decisions of the Standard.
+ *ceanglaí/ceanglaiste/ceanglaíste*
+ *ceagailte/ceangalta* (ceangailte)
+ *cuimlí/cuimliste/cuimlíste*
+ *cuimilte/cuimealta* (cuimilte)
+ *fosclaí/fosclaiste/fosclaíste*
+ *foscailte/foscalta* (oscailte)

## 2.  Verbs
### 2.0 Verb Classification
The verbs are traditionally classified into 2 conugations. Monosyallbic verbs and those ending in *-(e)áil* and a couple of other verbs in the first conjugation. Other verbs which have more than one syllable in their root are put in the second conjugation. The following are samples of the traditional conjugations.

1st Conjugation *bris, mol, faigh, suigh, sábháil, péinteáil, tiomáin, taispeáin.*  
2nd Conjugation *ceannaigh, imigh, ceangail, imir, foghlaim.*

In the Standard, the endings added to the first and second conjugation verbs are not the same. Those differences apply to the Habitual Present, Habitual Past, Future, the Conditional, especially. Although these differences demanded by the Standard are a reflection of Irish generally, they don't align exactly or entirely with some of the distinctions made in Ulster Irish. We'll describe now the main differences between Ulster Irish and the Standard.

#### The Present Tense
Classification of the Standard  
1st Conjugation - *briseann, molann, faigheann, suíonn, sábhálann, péinteálann, tiomáineann, taispeánann.*  
2nd Conjugation - *ceannaíonn, imíonn, ceanglaíonn, imríonn, foghlaimíonn.*

Regarding Ulster Irish and verb conjugation, there's three types of dialects to distinguish:

(i) Dialects where there's a long or half-length *í* in the ending *-(a)íonn*. This dialects tend to be in the south of Donegal, and this was the norm in Cavan Irish when it was spoken. This pronunciation will be shown with *í.*
+ *ceannaíonn, imíonn, imríonn, ceanglaíonn* etc.

(ii) Dialects where the long *í* is shortened in the ending *-(a)íonn.* Note that this short *i* is pronounced similar to the *ee* in English words like *meet, seat* etc. and not like in words like *sin, sit* etc. These dialects are found in west Donegal. This pronunciation will be shown with *-(a)io-* if needed.
+ *ceannaionn, imionn, imrionn, ceanglaionn* srl.

(iii) Other dialects where there's a neutral vowel in the second syllable. It could be said that the *-(e)ann* ending from the first dialect is used in the second conjugation in these dialects. These dialects are mostly in the east of Donegal, and the east of Ulster. There are areas where there's a mix of (ii) and (iii) in the north west of Donegal. This pronunciation will be shown with the spelling *-(e)ann.*
+ *ceannann, imeann, éireann, ceanglann, codlann* etc.

### 2.1 Conjugation of Verbs which have *-igh*
#### 2.1.1 Monosyllabic verbs ending with *-igh*
The *-igh* is only seen in the Standard spelling within the 2nd person singular imperative, and in the past tense. The *-igh* is dropped in the present and future tense for example, and in other tenses and moods. This tendency doesn't fit too well with the pronunciation of these verbs in Ulster Irish generally. Attention should be directed to two traits of this pronunciation:

(a) that the *gh* in the middle of the word is said when there is no other consonant after it. This happens in the Present, Past Habitual, and in the Imperative. There are two syllables in the forms below in Ulster Irish though The Standard doesn't show that.

| The Standard | Ulster Irish | Pronunciation |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| *léim*       | *léighim*    | *léyim*       |
| *léadh*      | *léigheadh*  | *léyú*        |
| *suíonn*     | *suigheann*  | *suiyann* \*  |
| dódh         | dóigheadh    | dóyú          | 

\* In the case of verbs like *suigh, luigh* etc. which have a short *i*, there's a tendency to make a long *í* out of the *iy*. Often the two syllables are kept in these verbs even when they have the long *í*, like this: *suí-ann*, *luí-ann*, and so on.

(b) In the Future and Conditional the *ghf* is changed as follows:

(i) The *ghf* is made into a *ch*, usually. It is pronounced as a slender *ch* or a *h*.  
(ii) In Teileann it's pronounced as a slender *f*.

| The Standard | Ulster Irish | Pronunciation    |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| *léifidh*    | léighfidh    | léichí/léifí     |
| léifeadh     | léighfeadh   | léichiú/léifiú   |
| suífidh      | suighfidh    | suichí/suifí     |
| dófaidh      | dóighfidh    | dóichí/dóifí     |
| dhóifeadh    | dhóighfeadh  | dhóichiú/dhóifiú | 

#### 2.1.2 *-idh/igh* Before Pronouns
There are two pronunciations of *-idh/igh* at the end of a word.

(i) Short or half-length *i* as in the English word *body* is how they're pronounced in answers to questions or when there isn't a personal pronoun after the verb.

(ii) they're made into a neutral vowel, like at the end of the English word *banana*, when before personal pronouns like *mé, tú, sé, sí* etc.

##### (i) Short or half-length *i.*
Remember that there are two syllables in the endings that correspond to the Standard's *-óidh/-eoidh* in Ulster Irish, in the (b) samples below. They will all use the spelling *-(e)ochaidh.*

(a) 
+ *Ar chualaidh Séan é? Níor/Char chualaidh.* (chuala)
+ *An bhfacaidh Máire an litir? Ní/Chan fhacaidh.* (bhfaca, fhaca)
+ *An mbuailfidh do mháthair leo? Buailfidh.*

(b)
+ *An gceannochaidh Pádraig iad? Ní cheannochaidh.* (gceannóidh, cheannóidh).
+ *An inseochaidh Síle dó é? Inseochaidh* (inseoidh).

(c)
+ *Ar cheannaigh an fear an carr? Níor/Char cheannaigh.*
+ *Ceannaigh amárach é.*

##### Neutral vowel.
What's between the () isn't said.
(a) 
+ *Ar chuala(idh) tú an scéal? Chualaidh.*
+ *An bhfaca(idh) sí fear an bhus? Ní fhacaidh.*

(b)
+ *Brisfi(dh) tú an fhuinneog.*
+ *An gceannocha(idh) sibh an leabhar?* (gceannóidh)
+ *Tá súil agam nach n-inseocha(idh) siad é.* (n-inseoidh)

(c)
+ *Cheanna(igh) siad teach eile.*
+ *Ar imi(gh) sé go fóill?*

(d)
+ *Be(idh) mé leat anois*
+ *Lé(igh) muid an leabhar.*
+ *Chua(igh) sé a luí luath.*

#### 2.1.3 Pronunciation of broad *dh* before certain pronouns
There's an important rule about the pronunciation fo the endings *-adh/-odh* in Ulster irish before pronouns/adjectives starting with *s*, when they are a **subect** in the sentence.

The *dh* is made into a slender *t* before the personal pronouns *sé/sí/sinn/sibh/siad* and the demonstrative pronouns *sin/seo/siúd.*

| Spelling                       | Pronunciation                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| *Mholfadh sé/sí thú.*          | *Mholhait sé/sí thú.*        |
| *Buaileadh siad bóthar*        | *Buailit siad bóthar.*       |
| *Bhíodh sí ann*                | *Bhít sí ann.*               |
| *Ná cuireadh sin isteach ort.* | *Ná cuirit sin isteach ort.* | 

This change doesn't happen before any other words starting with *s* and it doesn't happen before *sinn/sibh/sin/seo/siúd* when they are an **object** in the sentence.

| Spelling                   | Pronunciation            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| *D'íosfadh Seán é*         | *D'íosú Seán é.*         |
| *Bhíodh Síle ann.*         | *Bhíú Síle ann.*         |
| *Ar buaileadh sibh aréir?* | *Ar buailiú sibh aréir?* |
| *Cuireadh sin ina leith*   | *Cuiriú sin ina leith.*  |

### 2.2 Polysyllabic Verbs
#### 2.2.1 The endings *-(e)ochaidh/-(e)ochadh*
Regarding verbs like *ceannaigh, éirigh, ceangail, inis, iompair* etc. there are two syllables in the endings that go with them in the Future and Conditional. These are historical endings, of course, and they are written as *-(e)ochaidh* here. The *ch* in them is usually pronounced as a *h*. The endings could be written as *-(e)achaidh* as well, because they're said like that often. According to Wagner's Atlas, Volume IV, however, the two pronunciations are common.

| The Standard | Ulster Irish    | Pronunciation           |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| *ceannóidh*  | *ceannochaidh*  | *ceannohí/ceannahí*     |
| *cheannódh*  | *cheannochadh*  | *cheannohú/cheannahú*   |
| *ceanglóidh* | *ceanglochaidh* | *ceanglohí/ceanglahí*   |
| *cheanglódh* | *cheanglochadh* | *cheanglohú/cheanglahú* |
| *inseoidh*   | *inseochaidh*   | *inseohí/inseahí*       |
| *d'inseoinn* | *d'inseochainn* | *dinseohinn/dinseahinn* | 

#### 2.2.2 Syncopated verbs
Verbs like *ceangail, inis, imir, iompair* etc. are called syncopated verbs because the second syllable is dropped when another syllable starting with a vowel is added to them in various tenses. The Official Standard puts these verbs in the second conjugation, which means that *-(e)oidh/-óidh* and *-eodh/ódh* are the endings that go with them in the Future and Conditional, respectively. That's the conjugation that they're in in Ulster Irish for the most part too. In certain subdialects, Teileann for example, they are conjugated in a different way as shown below.

| The Standard | Teileann Irish |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| *ceanglóidh* | *ceangalaidh*  |
| *imreoidh*   | *imeraidh*     |
| *cosain*     | *cosanaidh*    |

The vowel in the second syllable of those verbs above is like *a* in the word *mac*. These versions are only said by old speakers. The endings discussed in 2.2.1 were said by young speakers.

### 2. 3 Personal endings
#### 2.3.1 The first conjugation
+ *-(e)am, -(a)imid/-(e)amaid, -(a)imis(t)/-(e)amais(t).*  
These are the most common personal endings in Ulster Irish outside of the specific endings in the Conditional Mood. Independent pronouns can be used in place of any of them as well.
+ *briseam - briseann mé*
+ *brisimid/briseamaid - briseann muid*
+ *brisfimid/brisfeamaid - brisfidh muid*
+ *bhrisfimis(t)/bhrisfeamais(t) - bhrisfeadh muid*

#### 2.3.2 The second conjugation
This is how the endings are with second conjugation verbs.
+ *ceannaíom/ceannam - ceannaíonn/ceannann mé*
+ *ceannaímid/ceannaimid - ceannaíonn/ceannann muid*
+ *ceannaíomaid/ceannamaid* - *ceannaíonn/ceannann muid*
+ ceannochaimid/ceannochamaid - ceannocha(idh) muid
+ *cheannochaimis(t)/cheannochamais(t) - cheannochadh muid*

### 2.4 Synthetic endings
In a few subdialects, special forms are used in answers. Wagner (1959) mentions this about Teileann Irish. The forms are found in the same model in the writing of Ulster Authors. These forms end in *-as* (Past) and *-ad* (Future). Here's how they're used and remember that they are common to every verb.
+ *Ar thuig tú sin? - Thuigeas/Níor thuigeas.*
+ *An bhfaca tú an bád? - Chonaiceas.*
+ *An ndéanfaidh tú é? - Dhéanfad*

Regarding the Standard's *-idís,* the analytic form is used in the Conditional/Imperative/Past Habitual across Ulster. 
+ *Dhíolfadh siad an teach*
+ *Bíodh siad agat ar maidin.*
+ *D'olfadh siad a sáith*
+ *Thigeadh siad chun an bhaile san Fhómhar.*
+ *Óladh siad a sáith.*
+ *Bhíodh siad ag caint air.*
