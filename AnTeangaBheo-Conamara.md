# 1. The Dialect
## 1.1 Connemara
This is the name usually given to the part of County Galway which is west of Lough Corrib. Long ago, the name only meant the west side of that area, but now it's usually means the whole area.

The name Connemara comes from the old tribal name *Conmaicne Mara*. Another old name for this area is *Iar-Chonnacht* (or *Iarthar Chonnacht*), but that name isn't used much now.

## 1.2 The Gaeltacht
From a language perspective, modern day Conamara is split into two parts. On the south side, by the sea, is the Gaeltacht: from Barna, on the outskirts of Galway City, over to Bertraghboy Bay (Roundstone Bay). English has long been dominant on the North side, as far as the main road from Galway to Cloghaun. But the bigger community is on the south side. Even so, there are some Irish speakers still on the north side, specifically around Recess.

## 1.3 Areas
South Connemara is split into various areas at the bays and there are small dialectal differences between them to note.
Here are the areas most often mentioned:
- *Cois Fharraige*: From Barna, west to Cashla Bay
- *An Cheathrú Rua* (Carrowroe): The Peninsula between Cashla Bay and Greatman's Bay
- *Na hOileáin* (The Islands): the islands in Greatman's Bay, particularly Gorumna, and Lettermullan.
- *Ros Muc* (Rosmuck): a long peninsula in Greatman's Bay
- *Cill Chiaráin* (Kilkieran): The western shore of Greatman's Bay
- *Carna*: The costal area around Carna village (the old name is *Iorras Aithneach*)

## 1.4 The Community
The Flahertys (*na Flaitheartaigh*) were the strongest tribe in Connemara in ancient times. The English got control of the area in the 17th century but it seems not many of them settled there. Even so, these most common connacht surnames in the community are: *Ó Conaire*, *Ó Conaola* (or *Mac Conaola*), *Mac Donncha, Ó Fathartaigh, Ó Flaitheartaigh, Ó Maolchiaráin*, etc. There are some common Norman surnames too: *Bairéad, Breathnach, de Búrca, Seoige.* There used to be some amount of people moving into the region, as is clear from the Munster surnames like *Ó Briain, Ó Gríofa, Ó Súilleabháin,* and Ulster surnames like *Ó Dónaill, Ó Griallais (Mac Niallais), Mac Suibhne.*

## 1.5 The Dialect
The dialect is a part of Connacht Irish and accordingly it has traits like these: the stress on the first syllable in words like *caipín, bacach;* the long vowel /i:/ in words like *caol, saor;* *rinne* in the past tense of the verb *déan;* *muid* instead of *sinn.*

But there are some traits in the dialect which link it with Munster Irish. Among those are:
- silent *dh* at the end of nouns, e.g. *samhradh* said as *samhra;*
- the word *arán* said as *rán;*
- the suffix *-adar* in the 3rd person plural past tense of the verb (*bhíodar, bhuaileadar*).

## 1.6 Special Traits
There are some traits which are specific to this dialect. Among those are:
- silent *mh* at the end of two syllable words, e.g. *talamh* said as *tala;*
- the diphthong /ai/ in some words like *oibre* (genitive), *poiblí;*
- /b/ at the end of *acu, orthu, etc.;*
- *tádar* sometimes, instead of *tá siad.*

There are some words in the dialect which aren't used much in any other region; a common example is *múr*, the local word for *cith*.

## 1.7 Varation
Like every other dialect there's a significant amount of variation to note here, i.e. two versions or more of the same word or phrase. In some cases, the two cases are found widely, e.g. the option of the synthetic or analytic forms in the 3rd person plural past (*bhíodar, bhí siad*). *uilig* and *uiliug* (7.7) are both found across the region, sometimes both by the same person.

Often one version relates to one specific area. There's a good few differences especially between the east side (Cois Fharraige) and the west side (Carna, Ros Muc, etc.). The most notable ones of them relate to /h/ between two vowels. That /h/ is dropped usually in Cois Fharraige, but it's preserved in the other dialects. A lot of words appear quite different because of that; e.g. *droichead*, it's said as /drohəd/ in Carna but as /dre:d/ in Cois Fharraige.

## 1.8 Writers of the Dialect
Since the cultivation of new Irish language literature started, a good few writers have come out of Connemara. Amongst the most famous ones were:
- *Mícheál Breathnach (1881-1908), Cois Fharraige;*
- *Máirtín Ó Cadhain (1905-1970), Cois Fharraige;*
- *Pádraic Ó Conaire (1882-1928), Ros Muc;*
- *Pádraic Óg Ó Conaire (1893-1971), Ros Muc;*
- *Séamus Mac Con Iomare (1891-1967), Carna;*
- *Colm Ó Gaora (1887-1954), Ros Muc.*

We should forget to mention *Pádraic Mac Piarais (1879-1916)* here too. Although he was from Dublin, he learned Connemara Irish in Ros Muc, his stories are mostly written in it.

Information about these authors and their work can be found in Breathnach and Ní Mhurchú (1986).
