# An Teanga Bheo - Gaeilge Chonamara
## 1. The Dialect
### 1.1 Connemara
This is the name usually given to the part of County Galway which is west of Lough Corrib. Long ago, the name only meant the west side of that area, but now it's usually means the whole area.

The name Connemara comes from the old tribal name *Conmaicne Mara*. Another old name for this area is *Iar-Chonnacht* (or *Iarthar Chonnacht*), but that name isn't used much now.

### 1.2 The Gaeltacht
From a language perspective, modern day Conamara is split into two parts. On the south side, by the sea, is the Gaeltacht: from Barna, on the outskirts of Galway City, over to Bertraghboy Bay (Roundstone Bay). English has long been dominant on the North side, as far as the main road from Galway to Cloghaun. But the bigger community is on the south side. Even so, there are some Irish speakers still on the north side, specifically around Recess.

### 1.3 Areas
South Connemara is split into various areas at the bays and there are small dialectal differences between them to note.
Here are the areas most often mentioned:
- *Cois Fharraige*: From Barna, west to Cashla Bay
- *An Cheathrú Rua* (Carrowroe): The Peninsula between Cashla Bay and Greatman's Bay
- *Na hOileáin* (The Islands): the islands in Greatman's Bay, particularly Gorumna, and Lettermullan.
- *Ros Muc* (Rosmuck): a long peninsula in Greatman's Bay
- *Cill Chiaráin* (Kilkieran): The western shore of Greatman's Bay
- *Carna*: The costal area around Carna village (the old name is *Iorras Aithneach*)

### 1.4 The Community
The Flahertys (*na Flaitheartaigh*) were the strongest tribe in Connemara in ancient times. The English got control of the area in the 17th century but it seems not many of them settled there. Even so, these most common connacht surnames in the community are: *Ó Conaire*, *Ó Conaola* (or *Mac Conaola*), *Mac Donncha, Ó Fathartaigh, Ó Flaitheartaigh, Ó Maolchiaráin*, etc. There are some common Norman surnames too: *Bairéad, Breathnach, de Búrca, Seoige.* There used to be some amount of people moving into the region, as is clear from the Munster surnames like *Ó Briain, Ó Gríofa, Ó Súilleabháin,* and Ulster surnames like *Ó Dónaill, Ó Griallais (Mac Niallais), Mac Suibhne.*

### 1.5 The Dialect
The dialect is a part of Connacht Irish and accordingly it has traits like these: the stress on the first syllable in words like *caipín, bacach;* the long vowel /i:/ in words like *caol, saor;* *rinne* in the past tense of the verb *déan;* *muid* instead of *sinn.*

But there are some traits in the dialect which link it with Munster Irish. Among those are:
- silent *dh* at the end of nouns, e.g. *samhradh* said as *samhra;*
- the word *arán* said as *rán;*
- the suffix *-adar* in the 3rd person plural past tense of the verb (*bhíodar, bhuaileadar*).

### 1.6 Special Traits
There are some traits which are specific to this dialect. Among those are:
- silent *mh* at the end of two syllable words, e.g. *talamh* said as *tala;*
- the diphthong /ai/ in some words like *oibre* (genitive), *poiblí;*
- /b/ at the end of *acu, orthu, etc.;*
- *tádar* sometimes, instead of *tá siad.*

There are some words in the dialect which aren't used much in any other region; a common example is *múr*, the local word for *cith*.

### 1.7 Varation
Like every other dialect there's a significant amount of variation to note here, i.e. two versions or more of the same word or phrase. In some cases, the two cases are found widely, e.g. the option of the synthetic or analytic forms in the 3rd person plural past (*bhíodar, bhí siad*). *uilig* and *uiliug* (7.7) are both found across the region, sometimes both by the same person.

Often one version relates to one specific area. There's a good few differences especially between the east side (Cois Fharraige) and the west side (Carna, Ros Muc, etc.). The most notable ones of them relate to /h/ between two vowels. That /h/ is dropped usually in Cois Fharraige, but it's preserved in the other dialects. A lot of words appear quite different because of that; e.g. *droichead*, it's said as /drohəd/ in Carna but as /dre:d/ in Cois Fharraige.

### 1.8 Writers of the Dialect
Since the cultivation of new Irish language literature started, a good few writers have come out of Connemara. Amongst the most famous ones were:
- *Mícheál Breathnach (1881-1908), Cois Fharraige;*
- *Máirtín Ó Cadhain (1905-1970), Cois Fharraige;*
- *Pádraic Ó Conaire (1882-1928), Ros Muc;*
- *Pádraic Óg Ó Conaire (1893-1971), Ros Muc;*
- *Séamus Mac Con Iomare (1891-1967), Carna;*
- *Colm Ó Gaora (1887-1954), Ros Muc.*

We shouldn't forget to mention *Pádraic Mac Piarais (1879-1916)* here too. Although he was from Dublin, he learned Connemara Irish in Ros Muc, his stories are mostly written in it.

Information about these authors and their work can be found in Breathnach and Ní Mhurchú (1986).

## 2. Pronunciation of Vowels
### 2.1 Short *a*
Short *a* = /a/. A vowel can be back or front depending on the environment: back /a/ in *baile*, front /a/ in *aire*.  
*ea-* = back /a/ usually: *eala, eangach.*

In some places (Carna) the front /a/ is used in words like *asal, hata tada.*

But the short vowel is preserved when there's another vowel after the consonant: /a/ in *ama* (genitive), /i/ in *binne* (comparative), /o/ in *polladh* (verbal noun).

### 2.13 Vowels before *rd, rl, rn*
The vowel before *rd, rl, rn* is long:

+ /ai/ in *Aibreán, oibleagáid, oibre* (genitive), *poiblí, toibreachaí* (plural of *tobar*).

### 2.16 Epenthetic Vowels
An epenthetic vowel goes into certain groups of consonants, as in every dialect; e.g. /ə/ between *r* and *g* in *dearg,* /i/ between *l* and *m* in *feilm.*

Here are the main groups: *lb (Albain), lbh (balbhán), lg (bolg), lm (feilm), nb (leanbaí), nbh (canbhás), nch (seanchas), nm (ainm), nmh (ainmhí), rb (borb), rbh (tairbhe), rch (dorcha), rf (dearfa), rg (dearg), rm (arm).*

There is also an epenthetic vowel in *colpa (calapa)* (i.e. calf of the leg).

### 2.17 *Syncopation*
The first syllable is syncopated in a few words: *biorán (breán), bolgam (blogam), coróin (cróin), foláir (fleár), furasta (frusta).*

*arán* is said as *rá*. But the article still puts *t* before it in the nominative: *an t-rán.*

There is syncopation in *coláiste, paráiste* in some places.

### 2.18 Stress
The stress is usually on the first syllable of the word. But it's on the second syllable in a few words: *dáiríre, Déardaoin, rosamh* (i.e. type of fog), *tobac, tráthnóna, uilig.* Along with in some new loans: *cáirdín* ('accordion'), *hotel, meaisín, perfum, tornapa.* But in the first syllable in *muisteais* ('moustache').

Instead of *éigin* (adjective), you get *icínt* (or *icín*) (unstressed); e.g. *fear-icínt* instead of *fear éigin.*

### 2.19 *camán* and Words like it
/u/ is the vowel in the first syllable of *camán* /ˈkuma:n/, and in other words of that shape: *bradán, cosán, gabáiste, paráiste, scadán, sparán.*

In the same way /i/ in the first syllable of *caisleán, geadán, gearán.* But /o/ in *beagán, ceachrán,* /u/ in *seangán.*

### 2.20 Exceptional Words
There are pronunciation exceptions with the vowels in some words. Here are some of the most common examples (the vowel in the first syllable is meant in two syllable words): *cat* /u/ (normally), *cait* (plural) /i/, *claí* /ai/, *coicís* /ai/, *deimhin* /i/, *doirt* /o:/, *faoileán* /ai/, *geimhreadh* /i:/, *ionann* /a/, *iontach* /i:/, *luí* /ai/, *nua* /u:/, *saibhir* /e/, *saibhreas* /ai/, *taibhse* /ai/.

### 2.21 Vowel Elision
A notable trait in the dialect is the elision of the neutral vowel /ə/. This happens regularly when another vowel comes before or after it. Here are some examples (the apostrophe shows the place where the elided vowel is):
+ *deoch 'ól*
+ *rud a 'fháil*
+ *ceann eil' acu*
+ *bhí hat' air*
+ *daoin' óga*
+ *tá 'dóthain aici*
+ *'bhfuil tusa 'g iarr' ubh?*

## 3. Pronunciation of Consonants
### 3.1 Broad *bh*
Broad *bh* = /v/ usually: *ábhar, bhuail, taobh.* There's very little friction except before consonants (*bhraith*) or at the end of a word (*sliabh*); outside of those two places it's almost identical to the English /w/ in *woe.*

## 4. Pronunciation: Various Words
### 4.1
The pronunciation of words in this dialect isn't always represented by the standard spelling. Sometimes it's just a matter of a different consonant quality: slender *n* instead of broad *n* in *dúin* (verb). In other cases there's a change of consonant: *t* instead of *d* in *tada*. In other cases again there's a different form of the word: *cisteanach* instead of *cistin.*

In the lists below the standard is given first, then the dialectal version.

### 4.2 Difference of Quality
*amárach : amáireach; amhras : aimhreas; clú : cliú; cosain : coisin; daid : deaide; damhsóir : daimhseoir; dún : dúin, Meiriceá : Meireacá, spórt : spóirt; stuif : stuf; ticéad : tuicéad; tiomáin : tomáin; tobann : toibeann; tóg : tóig; tuig : tig.*

### 4. 3 Change of Consonant
*cabáiste : gabáiste; contae : condae; cuardaigh : cuartaigh; dada : tada; feirm : feilm; priontáil : priondáil; taoide : taoille.*

As well as *glaoch*, *blaoch* is said (especially in Carna).

### 4.4  Separate Form
*áirithe : áirid; béile : béilí; captaen : caiptín; cé : céibh; cistin : cisteanach; claíomh : claimhe ; coiscéim : coisméig; deartháir : driotháir; deirfiúr : dreithiúr; diabhal : deabhal; eireaball : drioball; foighne : foighid; galar : galra; guí : guibhe; leithéid : leithide; pá : páí; práta : fata, spéaclaí : spéacláirí; stró : stróbh; suaimhneas : suimneas; taispeáin : spáin* (or *tuspáin*).

## 5. Initial Mutations
### 5.1
Through and through the rules pertaining to initial mutations in this dialect are similar to the rules of the standard. But there are a few small differences which are worth drawing attention to.

### 5.2 Lenition of *f*
*f* is sometimes left unlenited, especially when the lenition could make the word hard to recognise. Here are a couple of examples from Carna:
+ *cuid den foireann*
+ *Bhí sé 'na file mhaith.*
+ *Tá sí an-fearúil* (i.e. an-teanntásach).

(Lenition could be found in cases like those as well.)

### 5.3 Lenition of *s*
When slender *s* is lenited, it changed to /x´/ before a back vowel: *shiúil* /x´u:l´/. Before a front vowel it changes to /h/: *sheas* /has/. /x/ in *ó shin* often.

*s* isn't lenited in english names: *a Sarah, Micil Saile.*

### 5.4 Eclipsis following *sa*
*sa* (i.e. *ins an*) is followed by eclipsis: *sa mbaile, sa gcarr, sa bhfarraige.* Because of that, *m* isn't mutated: *sa mála, sa mí.* This eclipsis doesn't affect *d, t: sa doras, sa tine.*

*t* is prefixed to *s* in a feminine noun: *sa tsráid* (ach *sa saol*).

### 5.5 Lenition following *den, don*
*den, don* are followed by lenition: *den chapall, don fhear.* *d, t* don't get any mutation: *den tart, don duine.* But *t* is put before *s* usually: *den tsaol, don tsagart.*

### 5.6 Lenition following *ba*
Often lenition doesn't follow *ba* (the historic form of the copula): *ba col ceathar dó é; ba fear maith é; ba gránna é; an fear ba boichte san áit.* But there usually is lenition on specific adjectives: *ba bhreá, ba cheart, b'fhurasta, ba mhaith, ba mhór.*

### 5.7 The autonomous verb
The past tense autonomous verb isn't lenited normally: *baineadh é, níor tosaíodh é.* Often there isn't lenition on the autonomous verb in other tenses either (especially in Carna):
+ *Ma cailltear é.*
+ *Ní déanfaí anois é.*
+ *Cuirtí amach iad.*

But there's always lenition on *bheifí, bhítí.* Often there's a h before a verb in the past tense autonomous verb especially if there's a particle before it:
+ *Híocadh an t-airgead.*
+ *Níor hathraíodh é ní ba mhó.*
+ *Nuair a hairíodh é.*

### 5.8 Following the verbal noun
There is lenition on a nouns following a verbal noun in common phrases like *ag baint fheamainne, ag baint fhéir, ag cuir fhataí, ag díol mhóna.* Sometimes in other phrases too.

## 6. Nouns
### 6.1 Formation
There's a couple of points to mention regarding the formation of the noun in the dialect.

*-a* /ə/ at the end of some words ending in a consonant in the standard: *dorna, posta, rása, rotha, úlla.*

Broad *-r* in *dochtúr, saighdiúr, táilliúr.*

*-éara* instead of *-éir* in nouns for types of people: *feilméara, siúinéara, strainséara.*

The last consonant is often slender in the second declensions: *bois, bróig, cluais, cois, cnáimh, cuinneoig, gail inín, láimh, méir, muic.* (Broad consonants sometimes in some of those examples.)

### 6.2 Gender
*céibh, loch, páí* are feminine: *ceann na céibhe, timpeall na locha, an pháí.*

*curach, foireann* are sometimes masculine: *an curach, an foireann.* (But a feminine pronoun with *curach* like *bád*.)

*cleachtadh* lenites adjectives following it: *Tá cleachtadh mhaith agam air.*

### 6.3 Genitive without declension
There's a lot of adjectives which aren't declined in the genitive: in the dialect these are in the 4th declention. Amongst them are nouns ending in *-a (feilméara, posta), -adh (samhradh), -amh (scaitheamh), -acht (cosúlacht), -ú (athrú).* And these common nouns: *blas, cead, cion, culaith (cola), dream, neart, pian, rud.*

*ceann* ('one') isn't declined: *luach an cheann seo.*

### 6.4 Nouns ending in *-ach*
In masculine nouns ending in *-ach*, the *-ach* is dropped in the genitive: *bealacht, leath bealaigh (beala)* (3.10). Other examples: *aonach, cladach, éadach.* *iascach* isn't declined: *bád iascach* is what's said.

In feminine nouns the *-ach* changes to *-aí: gealach, solas na gealaí.* Other examples: *báisteach, cisteanach, toirneach.*

### 6.5 Irregular Nouns

### 6.6 Usage of the Genitive
It's typical to leave the the noun undeclined after *sórt: cén sórt lá a bhí agat?* Often also after *ar nós, beagán, mórán:*
+ *ar nós an seancharr* (Cois Fharraige)
+ *Tá beagán obaire tosaithe ann.* (Carna)
+ *Ní raibh mórán eolas acu air.* (Ros Muc)

Sometimes nouns are left undeclined in various other cases.

### 6.7 Plural: slenderisation
In the case of a lot of nouns of the of the first declensions, the final consonant is slenderised in the  plural: *an t-asal, na hasail.* Other examples: *bád, cat* (2.20), *cnoc, gasúr, oileán, páipéar, sagart.*

There is a few nouns that are slenderised in the standard but which have a different formation in this dialect. Among those are: *clár, clárachaí* (uaireanta cláir); *crann, crainnte (craínnte); éan, éanachaí; focal, focla; leabhar, leabhra.*

### 6.8 Nouns ending in *-ach*
There are 3 plural formations found among nouns ending in *-ach.*
+ (a) *-ch* in the middle: *an bacach, na bacaigh (baca).*
	+ Other examples: *bairneach, coileach, gliomach, ronnach.*
+ (b) *-aí* instead of *-ach: an bealach, na bealaí.*

	+ Other examples: *cailleach, curach, eangach, girseach.* Often *gliomach, ronnach* also have the (c) formation.

(b) Formation is most common in nouns for people from certain countries: *Éireannach, Meireacánach, Sasanach.* But *Francach* has formation (a).

### 6.9 The suffix *-anna*
*-í* is added to the suffix *-anna* in this dialect: *ceisteannaí.* Many monosyllabic nouns have this plural formation: *bláth, carr, deis, dream, loch, scoil.* It's what most monosyllabic loans have as well: *aint, bus, farc, mug, pleainc, seans.* The English plural is kept in *lads, sweets*.

### 6.10 The suffix *-acha*
*-í* is added to the suffix *-acha* usually: *cineálachaí.* This is the plural formation that some monosyllabic words: *áit, braon, méar, tír, tom.* along with some two syllable nouns: *nóiméad, seachtain, tinneas, tuairim, turas.* It's what most polysyllabic loans take: *cráifisc, sásar, uncail, engine.* The English pural is kept in a couple of cases: *bicycles, punctures, trawlers.*

### 6.11 The suffix *-a*
Some monosyllabic nouns of the second declension have the plural suffix *-a* /ə/: *bróg, bróga.* Other examples: *cearc, cloch, cos, lámh, muc, sceach.* But nouns ending *-eog, -óg* have the suffix *-aí: fuinneogaí, neantógaí.*

### 6.12 Irregular Plurals
A good few nouns have irregular plurals. Among those are the following:

*aill, álltrachaí; bó, beithí* (or *ba*); *bóthar, bóithrí; capall, caiple* (or *capaill*); *drioball, drible; garraí, garrantaí; gé géabha* (nó *géabhaí*); *léine, léintreachaí; meall, mealltrachaí, nead, neadrachaí; tonn, tonntrachaí.*

There's a couple of plural forms for *teach*: *tí* (Cois Fharraige), *titheabhaí* (Carna) are the two most common.

### 6.13 Genitive plural
The genitive plural is only used in set phrases like *geallta bád, beirt bhan, péire bróg, rástaí capall, teach na gcearc, clann inín, clann mhac, ag ceannach muc, ag iascach ronnach, radharc na súl.* (There are a lot of those phrases.)

In other cases the noun is left in the nominative plural normally: *togha na namhráin, ag déanamh báid, trasna na gnoic, go leor portáin óga.*

The article in the genitive plural is followed by eclipsis normally, but sometimes it's left out: *le hais na fir a bhí an t-am sin ann* (Carna) instead of *le hais na bhfir ...*

### 6.14 The vocative case
The last consonant is slenderised at the end of mens' names in the vocative: *a Choilm, a Mhaitéis, a Sheáin.* But *a Liam* without slenderisation.

A couple of other normal nouns are slenderised too: *' amadáin, a dheabhail.* But *mac* is left without slenderisation usually: *a mhac.*

*fear* has a vocative form in the plural: *'fheara.*

### 6.15 The dative case
A special form in the dative singular is found in a couple of phrases:

*Tá sé 'na bháistigh (bháiste).*  
*Tá sé as a chéill.*

*'na bháisteach, as a chiall* can be said as well.

*bróig, cois,* etc are dative (and dual) forms originally (6.1): *ar an mbróig, dhá bhróig.* But they're also used in the nominative now.

*Éirinn* is used in both the nominative and the dative.

### 6.16 *tigh*
*tigh* (*tí* or *ti*) is an old dative form. It's used in phrases like *tigh Chiaráin, tigh Mháire, tigh Mhicil.* It can be used for movement or position:
+ *Bhí mé thiar tigh Chiaráin,* i.e. in Ciarán's house.
+ *Chuaigh mé siar tigh Chiaráin,* i.e. to Ciarán's house.

*tigh* is always used in the names of shops and pubs: *tigh Mhoran* (in Carna), *tigh Chlarke* (in Ros Muc), *tigh Mháirtín Mhóir* (in Galway).

## 7. Adjectives
### 7.1 Lenition of adjectives
Adjectives are lenited according to the normal rules: *aimsir bhreá, áit mhór dhomhain, bliain thirim, saol an bhaile mhóir, cinn bheaga.*

Sometimes the adjective is heard without lenition after a feminine noun: *Gaeilge maith, roinnt maith, timpiste mór* (examples from Carna).

The emphatic adjective *beo* doesn't get lenited: *chuile oíchce beo, aon áit beo.*

### 7.2 Genitive singular
The genitive adjective is mostly in set phraes, place names and people's names:
+ *muintir na Trá Báine*

+ *scoil an Turlaigh Bhig*
+ *clann an duine bhoicht*
+ *ar fud an domhain mhóir*
+ *Páraic Stiofáin Mhóir*

Adjectives ending in *-ach* normally aren't declined: *aimsir an chogadh deireanach.*

### 7.3 Plural
Usually adjectives are put in the plural as well as the noun: *báid bheaga, daoine bochta, na báid seoil dehireanacha, cait fhiáine, mangaigh mhóra, daoine uaisle.*

But sometimes two syllable adjectives are left in the singular: *rudaí aisteach, scéalta álainn, daoine saibhir.*

### 7.4 Adjective Degrees
The adjective degrees are formed in the normal ways:
+ *bán : níos báine*
+ *bréagach : níos bréagaí*
+ *misniúil : níos mísniúla*

The vowel /a/ changes to
+ /e/ in *deas, deise; gar, gaire; glas, glaise; laig, laige*
+ /i/ in *ceart, cirte; geal, gile; glan, glaine; sean, sine*
+ /e/ or /i/ in *fada, faide.*

These irregular compositions should be noticed: *ard, airde /aird´ə/; breá, breácha; domhain, doimhne /daivN´ə/; fliuch, fleithí; minic, minicí; moch, mothaí; saibhir, saibhre /saivr´ə/; te, teocha; tirim, trioma.*

+ *uafásach : uafásach láidir*

### 7.6 Compound adjectives
These are the most common compound adjectives:
+ *corr- : corrdhuine, corruair*
+ *dea- (deá-) : dea-shampla, dea-scéal*
+ *dearg- : deargphleidhce*
+ *droch : drochaimsir, drochsheans*
+ *sean- : seancharr, seanteach*

In the case of *corr-* and *droch-* the stress is on the adjective or on both the adjective and the noun. In the case of *dea-* and *sean-* the stress is only on the adjective.

In the case of of *dearg-* the stress is on both the adjective and the noun. *dea-, dearg-* have very limited usage.

### Various Adectives
*aon.* - *t* (or *n*) is slender before it: *an t-aon áit (a 't-éan áit*). In *aon duine* the *d* is elided: *éanuine.*

*cibé, pé. - pé ar bith (péibí, féibí)* is what's used the most in this dialect: *pé ar bith fear a rinne é, pé ar bith cé a dúirt é, pé ar bith cé hé féin. cé ar bith (céibí)* exists too.

*éigin. - icínt* (or *icín*) is the version in this dialect: *áit icínt, caoi 'cínt.* the stress is always on the noun (2.18).

*gach, gachuile.* -  *chuile* is what is most said: *chuile dhuine, chuil' áit.* The preposition *i* is made into *sa* before it: *sa chuil' áit* (from *ins gach uile áit*). Sometimes *míle* is put after *chuile* emphasising it: *chuile mhíle ceann acu.* When it's referring to two things *chaon* /xe:n/ (from *gach aon*) is used: *chaon cheann acu.* *gach* is used by itself with the relative pronoun: *gach a bhfaca mise de.*

*iomaí.* - *iomú* is what's most said, but *iomaí* is in speech too: *is iomú áit a raibh mé, is iomú bliain ó shin é.*

*uilig.* - There are two versions, *uilig* and *uiliug* (stress on the second syllable in both): *an tír uilig, iad uilig, orthu uilig tá siad millte uilig.* Sometimes *go léir* is added to it: *iad uilig go léir.* (*uilig* is a shortening of *uile go léir*)

## 8. Numbers
### 8.1 Basic numbers
The numbers are as they are in the standard: *punt amháin, dhá phunt, trí phunt, ceithre (cheire) phunt, cúig phunt, sé phunt, seacht bpunt, ocht bpunt, naoi bpunt, deich bpunt, aon phunt déag, dhá phunt déag,* etc.

With the article: *an dá phunt, na trí phunt,* etc.

### 8.2 Singular or plural
The singular always follows *dhá: dhá lá, dhá bhliain, dhá cheann.* And the singular normally follows the other numbers. But plural in the case of the words *bliain, ceann, orlach, pingin (pínn), scór, seachtain, slat, troigh (tro), uair* (i.e. babhta): *trí bliana, trí cinn, trí horlaí, trí pingne, trí scóir, trí seachtainí, trí slata, trí troithe, trí huaire.* *bliain, pingin, scór, uair* have a special plural. The normal plural of those words are: *blianta, pingneachaí, scórtha, uaireanta.*

### 8.3 Choice between two numbers
When there's uncertainty about the number it's put like this: *bliain nó dhó, dó nó trí de bhlianta, trí nó ceathair de bhlianta,* and so on.

In this case, *ceann, cuairt* (i.e. babhta) have a special plural: *dó nó trí de cheanna, dó nó trí de chuarta.*

### 8.4 *ceann*
*ceann* is used for counting things: *ceann, dhá cheann, trí cinn,* etc.

Instead of *dhá cheann*, often *péire* is said: *níl fagtha ach péire, toram péir' eile.*

Sometimes *cinn* is used to mention the number of things: *seacht gcinn d'uibheacha* instead of *seacht n-ubh, deich gcinn fhichead de bháid* inistead of *deich mbád is fiche.*

### 8.5 *cúpla*
There are two versions of this word: *cupla* (/u/) and *cúpla* (/u:/).

*cupla* is the same as a small uncertain number: *cupla lá ó shin,* i.e. two or three days. *cupla* can't be used on its own, because of that *ceann* is put with it in cases like this: *níl uaim ach cupla ceann, cupla ceann de na cinn mhóra.*

*cúpla* is normally the same as two people, especially twins. One of them would be called *leathcheann cúpla*.

### 8.6 *fiche*
The singular follows *fiche: fiche bliain, fiche míle.* Here are some examples of the numbers which are based on *fiche:*
+ 21 : *bliain is fiche*
+ 30 : *deich mbliana fichead*
+ 35 : *cúig bliana déag is fiche*
+ 40 : *dhá fhichead bliain*
+ 45 : *cúig bliana is dá fhichead*
+ 50 : *deich mbliana is dá fhichead*

The new numbers *tríocha, daichead* (dathad), *caoga,* etc. are in use now too. Instead of *deich is dá fhichead* or *caoga* often *leathchéad* is said: *leathchéad bliain ó shin.*

There is a simple way as well to mention numbers above 20: *fiche cúig punt, tríocha cúig punt,* and so on.

### 8.7 *scór*
*scór* is often used instead of *fiche: scór blianta, scór daoine, scór mílte.* Normally it's followed by the plural, or the genitive plural if the word has that form: *scór fear, scór punt.*

High numbers can be based on *scór* as well: *dhá scór, trí scóir, ceithre scóir.* Those are used especially when someone's age is being mentioned: *tá sé na ceithre scóir.* 

### 8.8 Personal Numbers
To count people, *duine, beirt, triúr, ceathrar (ceathar),* etc. are said. Instead of *seachtar*, sometimes *mórsheisear* is said.

These personal numbers are also used along with nouns: *triúr iascairí.* They're normally followed by the plural: *beirt bhuachaillí, triúr lads, triúr mná, seachtar cailíní.* The old genitive plural is used in *beirt bhan, beirt dhriothár.* In some cases it could be the genitive plural or the nominative singular: *beirt dheithiúr, beirt fhear, beirt inín, beirt mhac.*

Sometimes *dhá* is used instead of *beirt: dhá bhean, dhá chailín, dhá mhac.*

### 8.9 What time is it?
The time is told as follows:
+ *Tá sé an dó a chlog, an trí a chlog, etc.*
+ *Tá sé cúig nóiméad tar éis a dó.*
+ *Tá sé ceathrú tar éis a dó.*
+ *Tá sé leathuair tar éis a dó.*
+ *Tá sé cúig nóiméad don dó.*
+ *Tá sé ceathrú don dó.*

Some turns of phrase relating to the time: 
+ *Tá sé i bhoisceacht cupla nóiméad don dó* (*i bhfoisceacht* is said as *úiceacht;* it is the same as *i ngiorracht*).
+ *Tá sé ag goil suas chuig a dó a chlog* (i.e. approaching two).
+ *Tá sé an dó a chlog caite* (i.e. it's after two).
+ *An bhfuil sé taobh leis an am sin?* ('Is that all the time it is?')
+ *Tá an t-am caite.* ('The time is up.')

## 9. Pronouns
### 9.1 *muid*
The personal pronouns in this dialect are teh same as the standard except for *muid* in the first person plural in place of *sinn:*
+ *Is as Gaillimh muid.*
+ *Chuala sé muid.*
+ *Muid féin a rinne é.*

*muid* is put with the verb too, where the synthetic form would be in the standard: *tá muid, rinne muid, bheadh muid,* etc.
+ *muide* is the emphatic form: *Is as Gaillimh muide.*

*sinn* is found in prayers like *go sábhála Dia sinn, Dia idir sinn agus an t-olc.* And *sinne* is the emphatic (9.6) : *lena linn sinne* (i.e. lenár linn-ne).

### 9.2 *tú*
In the 2nd singular there are the two forms , *tú* and *thú*, in the dialect. *tú* comes after verbs as a subject and following the copula: *d'imigh tú, is tú a bhí ann; thú* in other situations: *is as Gaillimh thú, chonaic mé thú.*

In the same way *tusa and thusa: chonaic tusa mise, chonaic mise thusa. Thusa* is normally in the second singular imperative: *bí thusa anseo, déan thusa é.*

### 9.3 *dor*
In places some people have a tendency to use *dor* instead of *siad* following verbs: *bíonn dor anseo go minic, nuair a thiocfas dor arís.* *tá dor* (instead of *tá siad*) is very common.

Many people look at this tendency as a corruption, and learners shouldn't imitate it.

### 9.4 The gender of pronouns
In the case of people, the gender follows the meaning: *is maith an cainteoir é, is maith an cainteoir í.*

In the case of animals, the pronoun agrees with the gender of the noun normally: *is deas an cat é, is breá an bhó í.* But a feminine pronoun is used for *capall: is breá an capall í.*

In the case of inanimate things, the pronoun agrees with the gender of the noun normally: feminine pronoun with *feamainn, móin, trá,* masculine pronoun *gaineamh, portach, uisce.*

Feminine pronouns are used to refer to boats, and often to cars; also often referring to books and newspapers.

Masculine pronouns are used with *áit (is deas an áit é), barúil (sin é mo bharúil féin), caoi (sin é an chaoi), uair (sin é an uair a d'imigh sé).*

### 9.5 The possessive adjective
In the 1st singular *(mo)* the vowel is elided before a noun beginning with a vowel: *m'ainm, m'fhear, m'inín.*

In the 2nd singular *(do)* the vowel is ellided and the *d* is turned into a *t: t'ainm, t'fhear, t'inín.*

In the plural, every person has *a* /ə/ normally:
+ Is ann a bhí muid 'na gcónaí
+ Tá sibh 'na gcodladh
+ Tá siad 'na gcónaí i nGaillimh

### 9.6 Emphasis
To emphasise the possessive adjective the emphatic particle *-sa* is put after the noun in the 1st singular and the 2nd singular: *mo cheannsa, do cheannsa.*

In the 3rd singular it's typical to use the emphatic pronoun: *a cheann seisean, a ceann sise* (stress on the emphatic pronoun).  That's how it is in the plural too normally: *a gcuid bealaí sinne, 'na n-áit sibhse, a gcuid Gaeilge siadsan.*

Instead of *ár dteachna*, *an teach seo againne* or *an teach sin againne* is said. In the same way, *an teach sin agaibhse.* Other nouns which take that formation are: *baile, dream, muintir, tír.*

### 9.7 *cuid*
*cuid* follows the possessive adjective in certain cases.

Before nouns in the plural: *mo chuid beithí, driothárachaí, leabhra, paidreachaí.*

Before nouns that don't have plurals: *mo chuid airgid, anró, cainte, móna, oibre.*

But *cuid* isn't always put before nouns in the plural: *mo chosa, mo lámha, mo shúile,* etc. are what's mostly said.
