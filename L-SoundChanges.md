# Sound Changes
In Irish, you may see the same word spelt differently, for example 
+ *Tá **bó** anseo*:: A **cow** is here
+ *Tá a **bhó** anseo*:: His **cow** is here
In the first example, cow is *bó*, and in the second it is *bhó*.

The reasons for this is that Irish has "initial sound changes", where the sound at the start of a word changes depending on certain circumstances. This may sound difficult but it's actually quite simple to learn the types of changes that can happen.

It's not necessary to learn every situation in which these changes are triggered, rather you should recognise the terms and the sound changes that are made, and as you learn something which causes them, you'll understand what it means.

## *Séimhiú* - Lenition
Lenition, known as *séimhiú* in Irish, means softening and is a sound change which can happen to most consonants in Irish, where they go from one sound to another. In the first example, [*bó*](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanM/b%C3%B3.mp3){:target="_blank"} becomes [*a bhó*](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/a_bhoo_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}.
This is represented in writing by adding a *h* after the consonant. 
Some consonants don't have lenited forms in the [[lárchanúint]], notably the sounds made by:
+ l, n, r, h
+ The consonants found only in borrowed words: j, v, x, z
The way each lenited form is pronounced is discussed in further detail in [[Lárchanúint Pronunciation|Pronunciation]]

An example of a trigger is *mo* which means "my", words following *mo* are lenited. 
+ *ceol*:: music ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/ga/Recordings.aspx?Ortho=ceol){:target="_blank"})
+ *mo c**h**eol*:: my music ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/ga/Recordings.aspx?Ortho=cheol){:target="_blank"})
Sounds without lenited forms remain the same, and no *h* is added in the spelling.
+ *leaba*:: bed ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/leaba_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"})
+ *mo leaba*:: my bed

## *Urú* - Eclipsis
Eclipsis, known as *urú* in Irish, is a sound change which can happen to some consonants and the vowels in Irish. It is represented in writing by putting one or more additional consonants before the beginning of the word.
For example:
+ *gaol*:: relation ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/gaol_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"})
+ *a **n**gaol*:: their relation ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/a_ngaol_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"})

The letters written change based on the original starting letter, as follows:
+ Vowel -> n- + vowel: *úll* -> *a **n**-úll*
+ b -> mb: *bord* -> *a **m**bord*
+ c -> gc: *cat* -> *a **g**cat*
+ d -> nd: *doras* -> *a **n**doras*
+ f -> bhf: *féar* -> *a **bh**féar*
+ g -> ng: *geata* -> *a **n**geata*
+ p -> bp: *poll* -> *a **b**poll*
+ t -> dt: *téad* -> *a **d**téad*

The pronunciation of the various eclipsed forms are explained in [[Lárchanúint Pronunciation|Pronunciation]]. Some sounds are not eclipsed, notably the sounds made by:
+ h, l, m, n, r, s
+ The consonants found only in borrowed words: j, v, x, z

An example of a trigger is *a* meaning "their" (*a* can also mean other things), words following *a* meaning "their" are eclipsed.
+ *guí*:: prayer ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/guii_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"})
+ *a **n**guí*:: their prayer ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/a_nguii_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"})

Note that the letters added to represent eclipsis are never capitalised, the "true" first letter of the word is. And in the event of a vowel being eclipsed and capitalised, the hyphen is removed
+ *Tír na **n**Óg*:: The Land of the Young

## *t-*
*t-* is sometimes added before vowels, similar to eclipsis the hyphen is removed if the word is capitalised. 
The pronunciation is discussed in [[Lárchanúint Pronunciation|Pronunciation]]. 

An example of a trigger of *t-* is *an* before a masculine noun in the nominative starting with a vowel. **(Don't worry if you don't know what that means as it will be explained later)** 
+ *airgead*:: money ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/airgead_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"})
+ *an **t**-airgead*:: the money ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/an_t-airgead_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"})

## *h*
*h* can be added to words starting with vowels, it is not followed by a hyphen in writing. It is important not to confuse this with lenition which is represented with a h *after a consonant*. The two are separate and are never triggered by the same things. The pronunciation is discussed in [[Lárchanúint Pronunciation|Pronunciation]].

One example is that a *h* is added before a vowel after the word *le*.
+ *aol*:: lime ([listen](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/aol.mp3){:target="_blank"})
+ *le **h**aol*:: with lime ([listen](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/le_haol_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"})

## *t(s)*
*t* can be added to words starting with *s* in some places. This is a special type of lenition, which can happen after the word *an*.

An example of a trigger of *t* is *an* before a feminine noun in the nominative starting with an *s*. **(Don't worry if you don't know what this means as it will be explained later)** 
+ *sraith*:: series ([listen](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/sraith.mp3){:target="_blank"})
+ *an **t**sraith*:: the series ([listen](https://voca.ro/1ldbiBNJtCTn){:target="_blank"})

## Conclusion
It's important to remember that these are primarily *sound* changes, and the way we write them is just a way to represent the change in pronunciation that occurs. Keep this in mind when going into the section on pronunciation.
