# Intro to Reading Irish Words
Now that we've established what sounds exist in Irish, we can talk about how to pronounce a word based on how it's written.

This is a beginner's guide, for a comprehensive reference see [[Lárchanúint Pronunciation]].

## Consonants
As discussed, Irish consonants can be either slender or broad, so the obvious question is how do we know from writing whether a consonant is slender or broad.

**A consonant is slender if there is an 'i' before it, or if it's at the beginnning of a word followed by an 'e' or an 'i'.** Otherwise it is broad.
Note: 'i' includes 'í' and 'e' includes 'é'.

Consonants next to one another are called consonant groups, all consonants in a group are the same type, either broad or slender with only a few exceptions.

Note that the /k/ and /kʹ/ sounds are actually represented by the letter 'c' in Irish writing.

Double consonants are pronounced the same as single consonants #TODO: ya know

Note: 'r' at the beginning of a word is always broad, /r/
+ rí - /riː/
+ reic - /rekʹ/

#### Some Examples
+ *meas* (respect) - /mʹas/
	+ We know that the 'm' is slender because it's at the start of the word, followed by an 'e'.
+ *brat* (flag) - /brat/
	+ Note here that both the 'b' and the 'r' are broad, as they are in a consonant group together
+ *cleas* (trick) - /kʹlʹas/
	+ Here both the 'c' and the 'l' are slender, as they are in a group together, at the start of a word followed by an 'e'. 
+ *cáis* (cheese) - /kaːsʹ/
	+ The 's' is slender because it follows an 'i'
+ *fís* (vision) - /fʹiːsʹ/
	+ The 'f' is slender because it's at the start of the word before an 'i', and the 's' is slender because it's after an 'i'

## Vowels
Vowels often trip up learners, because when they come in groups their pronunciation is not always obvious, and can depend on the stress. 

Stress is the amount of emphasis we put on a syllable. For example, the first syllable is stressed in the word "record" in the phrase "a record", but the second in the phrase "I record".

Usually the first syllable is stressed in Irish. Otherwise we mark stressed syllables with ' e.g. [/ə'nisʹ/](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/anois.mp3), the stress is on the second syllable. 

### Stressed Vowels
Single vowels are relatively simple, if they are stressed their pronunciation is the sound which shares their symbol.
+ a = /a/
+ e = /e/
+ i = /i/
+ u = /u/
+ o = /o/
+ á = /aː/
+ é = /eː/
+ í = /iː/
+ ú = /uː/
+ ó = /oː/

It can be a bit more confusing when there's more than one vowel.
If there's a vowel which has a *síneadh fada* on it (this line above the áéíúó), it is the one pronounced 
+ *ciúin* (quiet) - /kʹuːnʹ/
	+ Note here that while the ú is the only vowel sound pronounced, the other letters serve to show that the first c and last n are slender

Otherwise if all the vowels are short, you have to learn certain patterns
+ ea, ai = /a/ 
+ ei = /e/
+ io, ui = /i/
+ oi = /o/

And these next combinations are read as either a vowel combination or a long vowel
+ ao, aoi = /iː/
+ eo = /oː/
	+ with a few exceptions
+ ia = /iə/
+ ua = /uə/

Note that for the final two, despite being spelt with an 'a', there is not actually an /a/ sound.

#### Some Examples
+ *cas* (turn) - /kas/
	+ the single 'a' here is pronounced as /a/
+ *geal* (bright) - /gʹal/
	+ the 'ea' is pronounced as /a/
	+ because of the 'e' we know that the 'g'  is slender
+ *saol* (life) - /siːl/
	+ the 'ao' is pronounced as /iː/
+ *trua* (pity) - /truə/
	+ ua is pronounced /uə/

### Unstressed Vowels
If a short vowel is unstressed, it is pronounced as /ə/

If a long vowel is unstressed it is still pronounced normally.

#### Some Examples
+ *páiste* (child) - /paːsʹtʹə/
	the first syllable is stressed, so the unstressed 'e' is pronounced /ə/
+ *amadán* (idiot) - /amədaːn/
	+ the first syllable is stressed, so that 'a' is pronounced as /a/, the unstressed 'a' is pronounced as /ə/, and the unstressed 'á' is still pronounced as /aː/

## Lenition
Lenition was introduced previously, here we'll talk about how to read lenited consonants. We know if they are broad or slender depending  on the vowels around them, as with any consonants
+ mh, bh = /v/ or /vʹ/
+ ch = /x/ or /xʹ/
+ dh, gh = /ɣ/ or /ɣʹ/
+ fh is completely silent
+ ph = /f/ or /fʹ/
+ sh = /h/
	+ with some exceptions
+ th = /h/ 

#### Some Examples
+ *dhún* (closed) - /ɣuːn/
	+ dh = /ɣ/, because it's broad
+ *fhill* (returned) - /ilʹ/
	+ fh is silent
+ *cheap* (thought) - /xʹap/
	+ ch = /xʹ/, because it's slender
+ *thuill* (earned) - /hilʹ/
	+ th = /h/

## Eclipsis
Lenition was introduced previously, here we'll talk about how to read eclipsed consonants. We know if they are broad or slender depending  on the vowels around them, as with any consonants
+ Except for **n**g, when eclipsis occurs the original letter is silent and the added letter(s) is pronounced
	+ **m**b = /m/ or /mʹ/
	+ **g**c = /g/ or /gʹ/
	+ **n**d = /n/ or /nʹ/
	+ **bh**f = /v/ or /vʹ/
	+ **b**p = /b/ or /bʹ/
	+ **d**t = /d/ or /dʹ/
+ **n**g is pronounced as /ŋ/ or /ŋʹ/

#### Some Examples
+ *a ngol* (their crying) - /a ŋol/
+ a gciall (their sense) - /a giəl/
+ a bhfuinneog - /a vinʹoːg/

The information here is added to in the pages about verb forms, which are often exceptional in their pronunciation, and in the page about /ai/ and /au/.

There are various exceptions that aren't mentioned here, but can be seen in [[Lárchanúint Pronunciation]]
