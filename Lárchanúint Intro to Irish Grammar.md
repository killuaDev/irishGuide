# Intro to Irish Grammar
In this lesson we're going to look at several Irish sentences to understand how they are structured compared to English ones.
Then later on we will revisit each sentence to explain why each part is as it is, so don't worry if you don't understand everything in this initial overview.

##### *Dúnann an t-eolaí beag an fhuinneog mhór gach lá*  
/duːnən ə tʹoːliː bʹeg ən inʹoːg voːr gax laː/
+ The little scientist closes the big window every day.

The structure of an English sentence is Subject-Verb-Object
+ Subject: The little scientist
+ Verb: closes
+ Object: the big window

The subject is the part of the sentence *doing* the action, the verb is the *action*, and the object is what the action is being done to

The structure of an Irish sentence is **Verb-Subject-Object**
+ Verb: *Dúnann* 
+ Subject: *an t-eolaí beag* 
+ Object: *an fhuinneog mhór*

##### Tá an bhean sásta
/taːn vʹan saːstə/
+ The woman is happy.

Similar to in English you can use the verb 'to be' to combine a noun and some description of the noun, this takes on a similar structure as the last example.

English: Subject, to be, description
+ Subject: The woman
+ To be: is
+ Description: happy

Irish: To be, subject, description
+ To be: Tá
+ Subject: an bhean
+ Description: sásta

##### Is é Cormac an rí
/sʹeː korəməc ə(n) riː/
+ *Cormac* is the king.

This structure may seem unusual compared to the last one, but unlike in English, **you cannot combine two nouns using the verb "to be".** Instead we use something called the "copula" which has its own structures. 

The structure is this:
+ Copula: Is
+ Information: Cormac
+ Subject: An rí 

The *é* which is added does not convey any specific meaning, but is necessary because both nouns are definite, we're talking about *one specific Cormac* and *one specific king*, rather than *a* Cormac or *a* king.
The important thing to note here is that the information is given *first*. The information is that *Cormac* is the king, rather than anyone else, we are learning who the king is.
Compare that to *Is é an rí Cormac* (Cormac is *the king*), in which we are learning who Cormac is, he is the king.

#TODO: Should that info be moved to later

##### Is fear é Cormac
/is fʹar eː korəməc/
+ Cormac is a man.

This structure is very similar to the last one, but the é is added before *Cormac* rather than before *fear*, because Cormac is definite and *fear* isn't. *fear* simply means "a man". The indefinite part always comes first.

##### Is duine fear
/is dinʹə fʹar/
+ A man is a person

If both are indefinite there is no need for any *é*
