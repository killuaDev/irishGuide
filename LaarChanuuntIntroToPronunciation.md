# Intro to Pronunciation
## The Sounds of Irish 
It's important to realise that the sounds used in Irish are not the same as the sounds used in English, even if you speak an Irish dialect of English.

Irish as a language has different sounds to English, for example [this sound](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/a_ghaa_i3_s3.mp3). But what you may not realise is that lots of the sounds in Irish that sound *similar* to English are not the same as english sounds.

Irish has two versions of each consonant, a *broad* version and *slender* version. Often neither of these sounds are exactly the same as an English sound.
Take for example, *[bó](http://fuaimeanna.ie/ga/Recordings.aspx?Ortho=bó){:target="_blank"}*, *[beo](http://fuaimeanna.ie/ga/Recordings.aspx?Ortho=beo){:target="_blank"}*, *[buí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/ga/Recordings.aspx?Ortho=buí){:target="_blank"}*, and *[bí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/ga/Recordings.aspx?Ortho=bí){:target="_blank"}*. *Bó* and *buí* use a broad 'b', but *beo* and *bí* use a slender 'b'. It may sound like the broad 'b' is just 'bw' and the slender one is just 'by', but the difference is actually a little more subtle. Essentially the broad 'b' starts in a position similar to the 'w', with the lips more rounded, and the slender one starts in a position similar to the 'y' with lips spread. 

When talking about pronunciation, we will put letters between slashes, e.g. /b/ to show that we're talking about a specific sound, the meaning of all of these letters and symbols will be explained. The symbol ʹ will be added to indicate a slender consonant, otherwise it is be broad 
+ /b/ - broad 'b' sound
+ /bʹ/ - slender 'b' sound

Spelling will be talked about separately, so you needn't worry about the spelling of words given in this lesson though feel free to take note of any patterns.
## Consonants
Each group of consonants has a similar pattern between how the broad and slender sounds are pronounced.
When I refer to flattening your lips I mean making the gap between them long and thin, rather than rounded. 
+ 1.
	+ /b/ 
		+ as in *[bó](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/boo_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (cow)
		+ as in *[buí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/buii_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (yellow)
		+ This sound is similar to the English sound 'b', but the lips are rounded and pushed forward, and the back of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ /bʹ/
		+ as in *[beo](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/beo_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (alive)
		+ as in *[bí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/bii_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (be)
		+ This sound is similar to the English sound 'b', but the lips are flattened and the middle of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ /p/
		+ as in *[paca](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/paca.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (pack)
		+ This sound is similar to the English sound 'p', but the lips are rounded and pushed forward, and the back of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ /pʹ/
		+ as in *[peaca](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/peaca.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (sin)
		+  This sound is similar to the English sound 'p', but the lips are flattened and the middle of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ /m/
		+ as in *[maoin](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/maoin.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (wealth)
		+ This sound is similar to the English sound 'm', but the lips are rounded and pushed forward, and the back of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ /mʹ/
		+ as in *[mín](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/m%C3%ADn.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (smooth)
		+  This sound is similar to the English sound 'm', but the lips are flattened and the middle of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ The following sounds appear similar to english v and f, but they are pronounced with the two lips instead of the lips and the teeth 
	+ /v/
		+ as in *[bhán](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/bhaan_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (white)
		+ This sound is similar to the English sound 'w', except the lips are closer together and the back of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ /vʹ/
		+ as in *[bhí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/bhii_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (was)
		+ This sound is similar to the English sound 'v', except it's made with the lips alone, which are flattened and the middle of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ /f/
		+ as in *[fada](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/fada_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (long)
		+ This sound is similar to the English sound 'f', except it's made with the lips alone, which are rounded and pushed forward, and the back of the tongue is raised slightly.
	+ /fʹ/
		+ as in *[fill](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/fill_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (return)
		+  This sound is similar to the English sound 'f', except it's made with the lips alone, which are flattened and the middle of the tongue is raised slightly.
+ 2.
	+ /d/
		+ as in *[dó](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/doo_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (to him)
		+ Unlike the english sound 'd', which is usually made at the ridge behind the teeth, this sound is made at the teeth themselves, where the "th" in "this" would be made. Unlike "th" though, the tongue actually hits off the teeth rather than just creating friction with them
	+ /dʹ/
		+ as in *[deo](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/deo_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (ever)
		+ To make this sound, start by putting your mouth in the position to make the English 'd' sound and then raise the middle of your tongue slightly. The lips are flattened slightly.
	+ /t/
		+ as in *[tuí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/tuii_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (thatch)
		+ Unlike the english sound 't', which is usually made at the ridge behind the teeth, this sound is made at the teeth themselves, where the "th" in "thought" would be made. Unlike "th" though, the tongue actually hits off the teeth rather than just creating friction with them
	+ /tʹ/
		+ as in *[tí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/tii_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (of a house)
		+ To make this sound, start by putting your mouth in the position to make the English 't' sound and then raise the middle of your tongue slightly. The lips are flattened slightly
	+ /n/

		+ To make this sound, put your mouth in the position of an 'n' in the word 'nut', press your tongue towards the top of your teeth (where they meet the roof) and raise the back of your tongue slightly 
	+ /nʹ/
		+ as in *[ní](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/nii_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (not)
		+ To make this sound, put your mouth in the position of an 'n' in the word 'nick', and raise the middle of your tongue slightly 
	+ /l/
		+ as in *[lón](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/loon_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (lunch)
		+ To make this sound, put your mouth in the position of an 'l' in the word 'luck', press your tongue towards the top of your teeth (where they meet the roof) and raise the back of your tongue slightly 
	+ /lʹ/
		+ as in *[leon](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/leon_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (lion)
		+ To make this sound, put your mouth in the position of an 'l' in the word 'lick', and raise the middle of your tongue slightly 
+ 3.
	+ #TODO(format, add recording?): You can practice this distinction with the word "cookie", which has a sound similar to /k/ at the first syllable and one similar to /kʹ/ in the second, practice saying cookie and feel how your tongue moves between them. Now try using the same /k/ sound for both, and the same /kʹ/ sound for both
	+ /g/
		+ as in *[gall](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/gall_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (foreigner)
		+ To make this sound, put your mouth in position to say the 'g' in 'gut', but raise the back of your tongue up slightly more.
	+ /gʹ/
		+ as in *[geall](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/geall_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (promise)
		+ To make this sound, put your mouth in position to say the 'g' in 'gift', but raise the middle of your tongue up slightly more. The lips are flattened slightly
	+ /k/
		+ as in *[cad](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cad_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (what)

	+ /x/
		+ as in *[chun](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/chun.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (to)
		+ To make this sound, place your mouth as you would to make an English "c" sound as in "cut", but but instead of fully bringing your tongue up to touch the roof of your mouth, leave some space between the tongue and the roof.
	+ /xʹ/
		+ as in *[cheannaigh](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cheannaigh_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (bought)
		+ To make this sound, try making a sound similar to the start of the word "hue" (a "hy" sound), and raising the middle of your tongue, enough that you can hear some friction. The lips are flattened slightly.
	+ /ɣ/
		+ as in *[dhá](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/dh%C3%A1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (two)
		+ To make this sound, place your mouth as you would to make an English "g" sound as in "gut", but but instead of fully bringing your tongue up to touch the roof of your mouth, leave some space between the tongue and the roof.
	+ /ɣʹ/
		+ as in *[dhíol](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/dhiiol_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (sold)
		+ To make this sound, try making a sound similar to the English "y" in "yes", and raising the middle of your tongue, enough that you can hear some friction. The lips are flattened slightly.
	+ These next two sounds are often quite confusing to english speakers, as they are similar to the english "ng" sound in "sing" but can also occur at the start of words
	+ /ŋ/
		+ as in [ra**ng**](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/rang.mp3) (class)
		+ as in *[a **ng**ol](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/a_ngol_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (their crying) 
		+ This sound is similar to "ng" in "song" in English, but with the back of the tongue raised.
	+ /ŋʹ/
		+ as in *[tarrai**ng**](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/tarraing_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (draw)

		+ This sound is similar to the "ng" in "sing" in English, but with the middle of the tongue raised, the are lips flattened slightly.

+ 4. 
	+ /s/
		+ as in *[suí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/suii_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (sitting)
		+ To make this sound, put your mouth in the position of an 's' in the word 'suck', and raise the back of your tongue slightly 
	+ /sʹ/
		+ as in *[sí](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/sii_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (she)
		+ To make this sound, put your mouth in the position of 'sh' in 'she', and pull back your lips and raise the middle of your tongue slightly
+ 5.
	+ The 'r' sounds in Irish can be quite difficult for learners, as they don't have any English equivalent. Don't be discouraged if you can't make these sounds immediately as they can be some of the most difficult.
	+ /r/
		+ as in *[fuar](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/fuar_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (cold)
		+ This sound is similar to the 'r' in Spanish 'pero', if you don't know how to make this sound, it's made at the ridge behind your teeth, similar to the English 'd', but the sound is made by lightly tapping your tongue off of it.
		+ You may be able to practice making it by repeatedly switching between the sounds 'd' and 'l' quickly. 
		+ The back of the tongue is raised slightly for this sound. 
	+ /rʹ/
		+ as in *[fuair](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/fuair_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (got)
		+ #TODO: ?? This sound is similar (perhaps surprisingly) to the 's' in 'treasure', except the middle of your tongue should be raised up towards the roof of your mouth.
		+ This sound is similar to /r/ except the middle of the tongue is raised rather than the back creating some friction when this sound is made.
+ /h/ 
	+ as in *[hata](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanM/hata.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (hat)
	+ This consonant only has one form and it is pronounced the same as the english sound "h" in "hat" or "hit"

## Vowels
Something to be quite careful of as a learner of Irish is not to simply use the vowels you're used to in English, as there are many differences. In English we often use combinations of vowel sounds such as in the word "name", if you try to hold the long A vowel there you will hear that it shifts from an "eh" sound to an "ee" sound.
It's less practical to describe physically how to make vowel sounds, but you should be able to mimic them well if you listen to them
+ Long (the ː symbol represents a longer sound)
	+ /aː/
		+ This sound is similar to the vowel in "call" in many Irish and English accents, you may not be used to the sound if you speak with a North American accent, but comes relatively easy with practice.
		+ as in *[cás](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanM/c%C3%A1s.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[meán](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/me%C3%A1n.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[cáis](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanM/c%C3%A1is.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[meáin](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/meaain_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
	+ /eː/
		+ This is a long sound, and not a combination of two vowels like the English "long A" that we mentioned earlier, this can be unusual for some English speakers but the sound itself is not difficult to mimic.
		+ as in *[Gael](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/gael_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[céad](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/ceead_i1_s1.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[Gaeil](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/gaeil_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[céim](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/c%C3%A9im.mp3){:target="_blank"}* 
	+ /iː/
		+ This sound will be quite familiar to most English speakers as it is quite close to the English "ee" sound
		+ as in *[saol](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/saol.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[fíor](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/f%C3%ADor.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[saoil](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/saoil.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[sín](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/s%C3%ADn.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
	+ /oː/ 
		+ This sound is another one that English speakers may make a mistake with. In English there is often a combination of two vowels in the "long O" such as in "coat". In Irish this is one long sound.
		+ as in *[lón](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanM/l%C3%B3n.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[leon](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/leon.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[póit](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/pooit_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[feoil](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/feoil_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
	+ /uː/ 
		+ This sound is similar to the long "oo" sound in English, but it may be raised higher in your mouth than your normal English form (??)
		+ as in *[cúl](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/c%C3%BAl.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[diúl](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/di%C3%BAl.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[cúil](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/c%C3%BAil.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[ciúin](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanU/ci%C3%BAin.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
+ Short
	+ /a/
		+ This sound can be similar to the sounds in "cot" or "cat" #TODO: ehhh? lárchanúint doesn't distinguish these
		+ as in *[cad](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cad_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[cead](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cead_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[cait](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cait_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
	+ /e/
		+ This sound is like the short "e" in many dialects of english such as in "pet"
		+ as in *[geit](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/geit.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[deis](https://www.teanglann.ie/CanC/deis.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
	+ /i/
		+ This sound is like the short "i" in many dialects of english such as in "pin"
		+ as in *[cuir](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cuir_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[cinn](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cinn_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
	+ /o/
		+ This sound is similar to the English short "u" sound but is lower in the mouth
		+ as in *[cos](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cos_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[cois](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cois_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
	+ /u/
		+ This sound is similar to the English short "u" sound but is higher in the mouth, and is more rounded
		+ as in *[bun](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/bun_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
		+ as in *[triuf](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/triuf_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}*
	+ /ə/
		+ This sound is actually quite common in English, it is a neutral vowel meaning your mouth is quite relaxed when you make it, it occurs in unstressed syllables when they're said quickly such as
			+ **a**bout
			+ tel**e**phone
		+ as in the second syllable of *[fad**a**](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/fada_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (long)
		+ It can sound closer to the /i/ sound if it's surrounded by slender consonants
			+ as in the second syllable of *[air**e**](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/aire_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (minister)
+ Vowel Combinations
	+ /ai/
		+ This vowel combination sounds much like the english long "i" sound in "like" or "my"
		+ as in *[fadhb](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/fadhb_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (problem)
	+ /au/
		+ This vowel combination sounds much like the English "ou" sound in "flour" or "now"
		+ as in *[bodhar](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/bodhar_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (deaf)
	+ /uə/
		+ This vowel combination doesn't have an English equivalent, but it is a combination of a shortened /uː/ sound and the neutral /ə/ vowel. 
		+ as in *[cuan](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/cuan_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (harbour)
		+ as in *[buail](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/buail_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (hit)
	+ /iə/
		+ This vowel combination doesn't have an English equivalent, but it is a combination of a shortened /iː/ sound and the neutral /ə/ vowel.
		+ as in *[giall](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/giall_i3_s3.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (jaw)
		+ as in *[riail](http://fuaimeanna.ie/sounds/riail_i2_s2.mp3){:target="_blank"}* (rule)
		

## Exercises
Practice saying each of these sounds, paying attention to the recordings for any sounds you struggle with, don't worry if you can't get them yet, as pronunciation takes a lot of time to learn and perfect.

Looking back to check any symbols you can't remember, try figuring out how these words sound, and then listen to the recordings to see if you were right.

## Some notes
+ At the moment I've kind of gone with the clearest sounding examples I can to show the sound, perhaps at the expense of ease or consistency
+ There are other realisations of certain sounds, shall I explain them too?
	+ e.g. slender r being tapped vs being fricative
+ When options are given in the lárchanúint should I present those or choose one?
